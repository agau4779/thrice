				Throughout the semester, Theatre Rice receives various requests from on-campus and off-campus groups to perform at their events. We have performed for fraternity events, marathons, variety shows, fundraisers, and even had a tour at UC Davis. If you are interested in having Theatre Rice! perform at your event, please fill out the form in the link below. If you have any questions or concerns, please address them to <a href="mailto:assist@theatrerice.com">assist@theatrerice.com </a>. Please make sure to be as specific as you can about location, time, and what you would like Theatre Rice to perform.
