				The Auditions Infosession, held every semester at the beginning of the semester, provides a low-stress way to get to know Theatre Rice cast members, sample Theatre Rice group activities, ask questions, hear more about how we do what we do, and of course, <b>sign up for auditions</b>. You do <b>not</b> need to be Asian American or have theatre experience to join!
			</p>
			<p>
				We also accept <a href="submissions.shtml">submissions</a> of performance material. This includes dance, stand up comedy, music videos, monologues, performance art, plays, film, music, spoken word, poetry, and just about any creative medium imaginable.
