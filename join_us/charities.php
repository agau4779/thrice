			<h2>Charities</h2>
			<p>
				Every semester, Theatre Rice donates a percentage of each show's ticket sale proceeds to a specific organization, supporting the greater Asian American and performing arts communities. This amount is based on the amount of seats available for us to sell in the room we have, the cost we've set for that show's tickets, and how much we need to use to recuperate from the cost of putting on the show. While these vary, we always try to give approximately half of what we earn.

			<h3>Charity for Spring 2010 Showcase:</h3>
			<h4><a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sasc/">SASC Summer Institute</a></h4>
			<p>SASC started out in 2000 after a group of students attended a conference on the Southeast Asian diaspora and what has happened 25 years after the end of the Vietnam War. From this conference, the group of students along with Professor Um from U.C. Berkeley realized there are disparities within Southeast Asian communities. There was no space to dialogue about the issues within the Southeast Asian community on the UC Berkeley campus. Thus, SASC was born in late December 2000. Ever since, SASC strives to address the many issues our communities face with many different projects.</p>
