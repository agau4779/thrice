<B>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>I am one of those few people in Berkeley that actually
have lots of free time, so i decided to become like
the rest of you and get busy. For the rest of this
year, Theater Rice will forever be synonymous with
Mike Nguyen's life

</font>
<P><B>What did you expect to gain from TR?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>Man Theater Rice rocks, i have soo much fun hanging
out with these crazy kids. I guess the only thing i
expect is some good memories to look back at after im
working 9 to 5 for "the man" in my square cubicle
facing the wall while contemplating how to avoid my
nagging wife and 11 children when i get home. oh yeah,
I expect my GPA to drop as well. hooray 

</font>
<P><B>What are your favorite movies?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>Anything with Brad Pitt. He's the man. his acting
skills are amazing, as well as his ability to drive
the ladies wild. Id let him punch me in the face. Well
maybe just in the stomach actually. Well come to think
of it, he could just smudge my pumas. 

</font>
<P><B>What makes you smile? </B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>I love nice people. I think one reason i speak so
passionately about my berkeley experience is because
everyday i bump into amazing people, familiar ones as
well as new ones. I think it's so wonderful how often
i come home feeling just emotionally spent from
laughing and smiling all day with fun people that make
me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. yeeeah college!
