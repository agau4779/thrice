<B>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>I have always wanted to get involved in theatre since I was in high school.  High school drama was really cliquish so I always felt really alienated and excluded from doing drama in high school.  I saw Theatre Rice’s crazy flyering on Sproul my first semester at Berkeley and I decided to join the group without even having seen a show.</font>
<P><B>What did you expect to gain from TR?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>I have already gained so much from Theatre Rice in terms of skills that I can use in everyday life (i.e. performing onstage has greatly improved my public speaking abilities).  I hope to further develop these skills and to gain new ones as well.  Oh yeah, I’m also looking for a good time every Tuesday and Thursday evening.  
</font>
<P>Where do you see yourself in five years?
<BR><font color=#6699FF>Probably still at CAL (“Hi, I’m Chris, and I’m an eighth year, undeclared.”)  It’d be nice if one could make a living as a professional, full-time student.  But alas, I’ll probably be finally going out into the “real world.”  Then again, I’ve always wanted to go to culinary school, so maybe I’ll be over in New York or something (in the kitchen and on off-off-off-off Broadway productions).  
</font>
<P>
Who are your role models?
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
Chairman Takeshi Kaga of Kitchen Stadium.  It has always been my dream to own a Kitchen Stadium (with my own army of Iron Chefs), wear flamboyant, sequined suits, and to eat fried conger eel heads smothered in vanilla ice cream.  Aaaaah, now that would be the good life.  
</font>
<P>What are your favorite movies?
<BR><font color=#6699FF>Currently, my favorite film is Darren Aronofsky’s Requiem for a Dream.  I also used to be a really hardcore Star Wars fan and the ORIGINAL trilogy of films still has a place in my heart.  
</font>
<P>What makes you smile?
<BR><font color=#6699FF>Almost anything, really.  I walk around campus and smile at random things that I find particularly amusing (one time I saw one of those “Cal B-Safe” vehicles and it had smashed someone’s car door- I smiled at the irony).  I tend to smile/laugh at the most inopportune times, which I guess can be problematic, especially when at funerals.
