<B>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF> I got involved with Theatre Rice because I wanted to continue my interest in the performance arts in college.  I graduated high school, having done performed a few plays my senior year and I really knew that theatre was something I would like to further pursue.  When I joined this group I found each meeting to be really fun and an excellent way to use up study time. I also like being on stage, which probably won't happen for the rest of my tenure in Rice, unfortunately.</font>
<P><B>What did you expect to gain from TR?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF> After being in Rice for six semesters I don't feel that I can gain anymore than I already have.  I've pretty much done and seen all that I can. Maybe gaining new friendships and experiences could be an expectation.</font>
<P>Do you have any special talents?
<BR><font color=#6699FF> High Metabolism. Uncontrollable sweating through my feet and palms. Apparently being able to disgust girls when they look at my face.</font>
<P>Where do you see yourself in five years?
<BR><font color=#6699FF> Being a wealthy  multi-ten-thousandaire.</font>
<P>What are your favorite movies? 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey, Back To The Future Kindergarten Cop</font>
<P> What makes you smile? 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>Chubby Babies. Smiling Toddlers. Old Couples who still hold hands. Comic book conventions.</font>
