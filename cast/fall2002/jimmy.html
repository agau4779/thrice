<B>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>I first saw Theatre Rice when I was a senior at Berkeley High. I liked what I saw and decided that if I got into Berkeley, I would join Theatre Rice because I was always interested in performing, but was never encouraged in the past.</font>
<P><B>What did you expect to gain from TR?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>More experience as a performer, most especially as a director and writer.</font>
<P><B>Do you have any special talents?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>Sometimes, I can see beautiful naked girls and not get turned on (Not cuz I'm gay, not that there is anything wrong with that) I can also be a good liar.</font>
<P><B>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>Either in Film/Creative Writing/Ethnic Studies/Education graduate school, teaching English abroad or at community college, poetry slam circuit, making a movie or on a Hawaiian beach running my own night cafe and surfing during the day  (Swwweeeeeeeettttt)</font>
<P><b>Who are your role models?</b>
<BR><font color=#6699FF>Spike Lee, spoken word poet Bao Phi, Talib Kweli, Bob Marley, Professor Um, Giant Robot founders Eric Nakamura and Martin Wong, Amelie, (Babyface used to be one of my role models until he tried to change into a "Lenny Kravitz" wannabe)</font>
<P><B>What makes you smile?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>When people say they enjoyed the show, genuine people (who don't make excuses for who they are), when my mom acts quirky, listening to favorite songs I haven't heard in a while, eating good food like steak or Ben and Jerry's Ice cream</font>
