<B>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>My bro Brian got me into Theatre Rice.  The group looked like a lot of fun and I wanted to push myself to be able to perform in front of large crowds and to think quickly on my feet.  Uhh, putanginashet!
</font>
<P><B>What did you expect to gain from TR?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>In Rice, I hoped to gain confidence and a dope group of friends.  This actually did happen.  This is my 4th semester in Theatre Rice and I still learn something new at every meeting.  My goal for this semester is to improv more quickly and with more wit.
</font>
<P><B>Where do you see yourself in five years?</B>
<BR><font color=#6699FF>I really hope to be travelling the world or going to grad school, and giving a lot to my mama and bros.  But more likely, I think I'll end up working, hopefully with kids.  Maybe I will have a kid of my own by then...
</font>
<P><B>Who are your role models?</B>
<BR><font color=#6699FF>My mama is probably my biggest role model.  She's superwoman.  After her, my other role models are Michelle Branch, Lauryn Hill and Margaret Cho for their strength through adversity and for being the creative women that they are.
</font>
<P><B>
What makes you smile?</B>
<BR><font color=#6699FF>My family, friends, sunsets, sunrises, shooting stars, poems that end with "so I can get to know you, and f*ck you," watching people, making people laugh, karaoke, mind fcuk conversations, videocameras, Theatre Rice, aliens and kiddies.  Holla!
