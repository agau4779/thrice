<B>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>I've been a TR groupie since 1999.  It was really great seeing Asians/Asian Americans doing comedy and drama, particularly improvisational theater.  Theater is my passion and every year I usually work on a theater project with local Asian theater groups.  It wasn't until 2001 that I joined Theatre Rice.  I regret not joining earlier.</font>
<P><B>What did you expect to gain from TR?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>I hope to discover more things about myself as an actor, and to develop any skills on which I need work.  I also hope to share some of my limited knowledge and expertise in theatrical arts to my peers.</font>

<P><B>What do you do after Theatre Rice meetings?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>I smile and grin like a silly little child. Each meeting is like a shot of sugary candy that goes through my veins like silky smooth donut glaze in your mouth, such as the one on Krispy Kreme doughnuts (plain glazed). The milky sweetness of that glaze just want to make love with my tongue...</font>
<P><B>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>I hope to see myself happy in five years... and to finally get laid.</font>
<P><B>What are your favorite movies?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>The Neverending Story... toootoootoootoootootoooo.... Anne of Green Gables, The Sound of Music, Amelie, Singing in the Rain, Hiyas ng Yamashita (Yamashita Treasure), StarWars, Zuma (the bald guy that has a two headed snake around his shoulder, and he eats people's hearts...a Filipino folk-horror character)</font>
<P><B>What makes you smile?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>good friends and good food... sometimes they don't make me smile physically, but they make my heart smile.</font>
