<B>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice? </b>
<BR><font color=#6699FF>I was
first introduced to TR through Reach.  Having a
genuine interest in drama, I thought TR would be a
good forum for me because the people involved seemed
to be very approachable as well as sincere and devoted
to acting.</font>
<P><B>What did you expect to gain from TR?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>Through
TR I want to understand how people acquire acting
techniques.  I would like my experience to uncover the
many levels of an actor’s mind and functions.  I am
hoping this forum will help me uncover the
psychological and motivational factors a person has to
drop inhibitions.  I want to see how people let
themselves go and feel while trying to control raw
emotions.</font>
<P><B>Where do you see yourself in five years? </B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>If all goes 
well, in five, I would hope to have graduated from 
Berkeley with a marketable degree and go to law school or work on a ethnographic mapping research 
project in Hue, Vietnam. If none of these things come 
up I am going to go back to my hometown of Pomona, get
my credential and teach at Pomona High School.
</font>
<P><B>Who are your role models? 
</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>...Chaucer and Indiana Jones come to mind, but in
reality my role models include many, but most
importantly my Mommy Dearest. Just knowing who she is
and what she’s done makes me feel motivated to just
look for happiness in life and do the best for myself
to help my family and others if I can. 
</font>
<P><B>What makes you smile? </B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>The simple things in life, the 
small gestures which exhibit consideration and care 
are just some of the things which make me smile. I 
love to see growth and beauty in human beings, in
whatever shape or form. </font>
