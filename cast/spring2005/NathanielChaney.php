<p><strong>1) Who are you?</strong><br>
  Who am I? I don't really know who I am, that's why I'm doing the
whole college thing. I guess you can call me an egg if you want, I
don't mind and it won't be the first time, but really I'm just the
crazy guy trying to make everyone else look sane. </p>

<p><strong>2) Why are you in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>
  I am in Theatre Rice because I wanted to try something new and
wanted to push my comfort zone. And trust me Rice has already pushed
it¡K. </p>

<p><strong>3) What are you searching for?</strong><br>
  Eternal love and happiness, but if I can't get that¡K a really good
bowl of ramen will do nicely. Other things I'm looking for: the other
sock that always goes missing, my sanity, the answer to how to really
get superpowers, pogs, a way to marry into wealth and never work a day
in my life, the answers to the UGBA-10 tests, and a genie in a bottle,
and the mystical sword¡K()XXX{:::::::::::::::::::::>, never mind, found
it. </p>

<p> <strong>4) What other extra-curricular activities are you involved
in? </strong><br>
 I have to say between rice and school my time is pretty full, but all
my props have to go to RBC or to you newbs out there Rubber Band Club,
oh yes rubber band as a deadly weapon. </p>

<p> <strong>5) What do you look for in an ideal mate?</strong><br>
  That fact that she is nothing like me. If I had to have sex with
myself I would go crazy. No seriously, what I want is just a great
personality and who I can evolve with, because relationships are like
ameba some of them evolve and some don't and the ones that don't die,
mwahhahahahahaha. Sry¡K </p>

<p> <strong>6) Why are you in your major? </strong><br>
 I want to sell refrigerators to Eskimo's. </p>

<p> <strong>7) What do you do in your free time?</strong><br>
  Homework¡K¡K hahaha, jk. Lol, stfu, rofl..sry.. Ummm let me see, I
like to go and party, that might seem cliche'd for a college student,
but who cares, other then that I try to stay out of the sun because I
burn¡K..</p>

<p> <strong>8) Who's your favorite artist (musical, or whatever)?</strong><br>
 Questions like this are always hard because you can't pick just
one¡K.I am really into hard rock alternative with some influences by
classic rock¡K.with this said I like Incubus, Godsmack, Papa Roach,
Deftones, Pink Floyd, Chevelle, Tool, A Perfect Circle, Lost Prophets,
Trapt, Die Trynig, Hoobastank, Rammstien, The Lonely Kings, Rage
Against the Machine, System of a Down, Sound Garden, Audioslave, Alice
in Chains, The Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Nirvana, Seether, Velvet
Revolver, The Doors, Led Zepplin, Cream, Thrice, Emery</p>

<p> <strong>9) It's 3am, you're finishing your homework. All of a sudden you're
  craving something. What is it?</strong><br>
  Top dog </p>

<p> <strong>10) An extremeley hot person is next to you, but so is a delicious
  hot pastrami sandwich. What do you do?</strong><br>
  Put your arms around both of those hot sexy things, make out with
the chick, then take a bite of the sandwich¡K..and maybe more </p>

<p> <strong>11) If your best friend came up to you and said he/she hates you,
  and then proceeds to kick your ass, what would you do?</strong><br>
  Kick his ass back, grrrrrrrrrrrrr, then when we're both bloody pulps
ask what this was all about and realize it was our invisible acting
scene and I forgot about¡K. <br><br>
