<p><strong>1) Who are you?</strong><br>

   I am just some crazy kid trying to figure out the world, be happy, land with both feet on the ground, and have some change in my pocket with my soul intact.  </p>

 

 

<p><strong>2) Why are you in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

   Lets face it, I¡¦m a theatre ho. I love rice, I love the shows, I love the people. I like to treat the new members as meat. I only wish I didn¡¦t have to watch other people leave. In the words of Brian Corpus, ¡§If Theatre Rice was never created think of all the people that would never have become friends¡¨. I add on to that ¡§just think of all the people that would have never dated or gotten booty!¡¨ I just hope that I have done and continue to do something good for someone other than myself.
  </p>

 

<p><strong>3) What are you searching for?</strong><br>

   A sewing machine, a soul mate, and my freaking 250$ glasses that I had for a week before I lost them. I need a soul mate with a sewing machine who makes glasses!  But seriously, HAVE YOU SEEN MY GLASSES??? </p>

 

<p> <strong>4) What other extra-curricular activities are you involved 

in? </strong><br>

  Haha!! There is more to life than rice??? UC Berkeley Bombardment Society, Ethnic Studies Student Union, Mc Nair Scholars program (guess which ones are real)   </p>

 

<p> <strong>5) What do you look for in an ideal
 mate?</strong><br>

   Well, since the purpose of mating is to produce fertile offspring I guess that means ideally they would in theory be human. Uther then thot I geuss theyd hav to be a guud spell cheker.  5  </p>

 

<p> <strong>6) Why are you in your major? </strong><br>

  cuz  </p>

 

<p> <strong>7) What do you do in your free time?</strong><br>

  Molest people with my eyes, dance, read magazines on the toilet (god I love that), consume, pretend to be cool, hang out with the estrofesters, listen to music, chat on aim, walk around with headphones on.  </p>

 

<p> <strong>8) Who's your favorite artist (musical, or 

whatever)?</strong><br>

   BJORK BJORK AND BJORK, Michele Gondry, =w=, yeah yeah yeahs, Nick Park, Rachael Dratch, Steinbeck, Shel Silverstien, Wes Anderson, RATM, Jason Shiga, Modest Mouse, Bob Ross, Lisa Frank, Carl Sagan...  #8  </p>

 

<p> <strong>9) It's 3am, you're finishing your homework. All of a 

sudden you're craving something. What is it?</strong><br>

   A watch that freezes time so I can sleep for longer, gravity on my ceiling, and a magic kind of Cherry Garcia that has negative 300 calories and dental restoring properties. For me, at three in the morning, all of this is possible.  </p>

 

<p> <strong>10) An extremely hot person is next to you, but so is a delicious hot pastrami sandwich. What do you do?</strong><br>

   After I suavely woe my future soul mate I offer them the hot pastrami sandwich as a token of our betrothal. And that would be the first and last time I prepared them food!  </p>

 

<p> <strong>11) If your best friend came up
 to you and said he/she 

hates you, and then proceeds to kick your ass, what would you do?</strong><br>

   I would rip out their left eye with my bear hand, or at least poke at it. If they are going to be victorious, they will have to wallow in their glory with one freakin eye!  <br><br>
