<p><strong>1) Who are you?</strong><br>
  I am an artist, a painter, a poet, a filmmaker, a part-time nihilist, a dreamer, a lover of nature, of raindrops, (sob sob), a person who makes mistakes, tries to relieve some of the pain in this world, and I revel in the burst of my existence.</p>


<p><strong>2) Why are you in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>
  I was looking for love, life, and happiness (isn¡¦t that everyone?) and I found it. I am surrounded by creative, vibrant, inspiring awesome friends. Yes, we possibly might all be working 8-5 someday, but theatre, poetry, art, is what I live for. It¡¦s what keeps me alive. It¡¦s what I¡¦d die for. (God! I¡¦m such emo, sorry guys)</p>

<p><strong>3) What are you searching for?</strong><br>
A simple life where things made sense: Of chocolate pocky, legos, and teenage mutant ninja turtles. I am looking for an honest and the purest kind of love between friends, family, lovers, that transcends the corporeal frame, the stuff that takes a lot of time, mistakes, patience, and afternoon cartoons! </p>

<p> <strong>4) What other extra-curricular activities are you involved in? </strong><br>
 Mentoring International Students (mostly from Japan), Outward Bound(rock-climbing expeditions) </p>

<p> <strong>5) What do you look for in an ideal mate?</strong><br>
 
I can give a list, but it won't suffice. Someone who will watch the sky change over time, someone who will camp in the middle of nowhere with me, with a sketchbook, some markers, and a sense of being in the moment. Someone who will make me laugh and also laugh at my bad jokes. Someone who tries to swing and salsa, watch cartoons, play sock puppet theatre and make film fests with me. Who doesn¡¦t have all the answers, who is not as confident as he looks on the outside.. . Who is independent, thoughtful, honest, passionate about life, (a kitty lover ¡V please apply bellow =) </p>

<p> <strong>6) Why are you in your major? </strong><br>
 My parents used to give me a hard time about being an artist; they thought all artists are crazy, depressed, drunk, or gay. Well, hmm... where was I? Officially, I am under Visual and Literary Theory (ie. English) but I am really in Film Production. Because film/theatre is a medium for social change. Because I LOOOVE it.</p>

<p> <strong>7) What do you do in your free time?</strong><br>
  Free time? </p>

<p> <strong>8) Who's your favorite artist (musical, or whatever)?</strong><br>
  Tim Burton - Edward Scissor Hands/ Nightmare Before Christmas<br>
Guy Richie (before Madonna shit)<br>
Darren Aronofsky ¡V Pi, Requiem for a Dream<br>
The Autumns (go emo! Please make your next album)</p>

<p> <strong>9) It's 3am, you're finishing your homework. All of a sudden you're
  craving something. What is it?</strong><br>
  A good laugh.</p>

<p> <strong>10) An extremeley hot person is next to you, but so is a delicious
  hot pastrami sandwich. What do you do?</strong><br>
  Duh! the pastrami, of course. (beat) But I'm vegetarian. Unless you have some tofu with soy sauce... straight from the box. So I guess, (sigh), it¡¦ll have to be the extremely hot person. </p>

<p> <strong>11) If your best friend came up to you and said he/she hates you,
  and then proceeds to kick your ass, what would you do?</strong><br>
  I would write his/her character into my next film! Muuaahhahahhaa!!! Revenge is mine! (evil pose) Or, I¡¦ll just probably strum on my guitar and write a sob song about being kicked in the ass by my best friend (sob sob)<br><br>
