<p><strong>1) Who are you?</strong><br>
  I am Amos. I'm from Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Go Heels! C'mon and raise up baybee. </p>


<p><strong>2) Why are you in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>
  Many moons ago on the eve of my 19th birthday, my people sent me on a spirit quest as such a journey is the necessary step for a tribe member to pass into manhood. An eighteen mile trek and a couple of heavy doses of peyote later, I was spirit questin' all over the place. A white tiger emerged from the wood and said to me, "Amos, my son. Before the dawn of the month of February, you must join a modern Asian-American theater group in order for your spiritual transformation to be complete. Thus, Theatre Rice seemed like the logical option. Of course, if you are so much of a loser as to not believe that story, I may just tell you that three Theatre Rice members were in my acting class first semester and they got me to go to a show and it was really cool and I wanted to join so I did. So there. </p>

<p><strong>3) What are you searching for?</strong><br>
  In life, I'm searching for happiness. At Berkeley I'm searching for some knowlege, fun, and college memories. In my own little personal bubble I'm always searching for something to say that might make you like me (please like me). In my dorm room, I'm searching for the stray cat that wandered in here three days ago. Maybe I'll follow the ants. </p>

<p> <strong>4) What other extra-curricular activities are you involved in? </strong><br>
 I'm on the Cal Squash Team. Yay squash! </p>

<p> <strong>5) What do you look for in an ideal mate?</strong><br>
  Good looks, smartocity, a sense of humor, phermones that can attract me (a potential mate) from miles away...you know how it goes. Also, it is super hot if she doesn't just bow to my whims/opinions/antics and actually questions/challenges me on occasion to keep my big head and various escapades in check. Yes, confidence is always a good thing. It also helps to be flirty...but only around me. ME! ME! ME! </p>

<p> <strong>6) Why are you in your major? </strong><br>
 Because I'm super indecisive. Well, I'm not THAT indecisive. Then again, every now and then I guess I can't really make up my mind. But really, that's only sometimes... </p>

<p> <strong>7) What do you do in your free time?</strong><br>
  Rock climb, unicycle, when I'm feeling hardcore I mountain unicycle (such a thing exists, yes), drum (drum set and djembe), make music on my dear Mac, play squash, watch Carolina basketball, sneak around... </p>

<p> <strong>8) Who's your favorite artist (musical, or whatever)?</strong><br>
  Wow. Tough question. Errr...can't narrow down musical artist. Check out facebook for that one. In the department of artist artists I'm a fan of Goya and Dali. Yay for Spanish painters. As for sandwich artists, I'm gonna have to go with Subway. </p>

<p> <strong>9) It's 3am, you're finishing your homework. All of a sudden you're
  craving something. What is it?</strong><br>
  Some sweel, sweet lovin'. That and applesauce. Mmmmmm....applesauce. </p>

<p> <strong>10) An extremeley hot person is next to you, but so is a delicious
  hot pastrami sandwich. What do you do?</strong><br>
  Look left. Look right. Breathe, breathe...... focus.... fooooooocusssssssssss... thennnnnnn.... GRABTHEMBOTHANDSPRINTFORTHEBORDER!!!! Yeehaw! We split the sandwich, I propose, and we find eternall love and happiness through each other's presence. And then I wipe here cheek because she got a little mustard on it....yeah, right there....on the left...yea--no, my left. There, you got it. Anyway, we stumble upon an undiscovered diamond mind, make bajillions, and donate most of it to noble world causes and charities. We save a little for a nice house and so we can buy a lifetime supply of hot pastrami sandwiches so we will never again leave that type up thing up to a chance encounter. Then I ask her her name. I forgot about that. How embarrassing. </p>

<p> <strong>11) If your best friend came up to you and said he/she hates you,
  and then proceeds to kick your ass, what would you do?</strong><br>
  Cry. A lot. Seriously, no funny answer here. That would suck. <br><br>
