<p><strong>1) Who are you?</strong><br>
  i am lisa, and i like pizza. i rock my own world, and everyone else's world. rick kitagawa worships and admires me. i don't know why i put that in there, but i think it's funny. i used "dumplings" to find my love and that's kind of ironic because in a sense, i am still trying to find myself.</p>


<p><strong>2) Why are you in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>
  i strongly believe in our mission statement and what we are trying to accomplish as a group. oh, i like rice too, on top of that.</p>

<p><strong>3) What are you searching for?</strong><br>
  i am forever searching for a pink hippo in tutus. if you find one, please let me know. </p>

<p> <strong>4) What other extra-curricular activities are you involved in? </strong><br>
 listen to me on KALX - 90.7 FM every tuesday afternoon for your loca/national/international news at 5:30 pm. i am hoping to get my own radio show soon so you don't have to call my cell phone number anymore just to hear my voice. diana quach and i are co-founders of L.D.A. (long distance anonymous). if you are in a long distance relationship and desperately in need of support and encouragement, please come to our sessions! </p>

<p> <strong>5) What do you look for in an ideal mate?</strong><br>
  to speak in idealistic form violates the principles of relationships. so if i were to describe my ideal mate, i'll have to accept the fact that he doesn't exist. </p>

<p> <strong>6) Why are you in your major? </strong><br>
 because i am an attention-deprived child? ok that's not true. i think my majors are pretty self-explanatory. it's all in one word - passion. god that sounds so cheesy. </p>

<p> <strong>7) What do you do in your free time?</strong><br>
  i sleep, eat, attempt to cook, have movie nights with my roommate valery, enjoy good conversations with people, read, write, stare out the window, laughing, and did i mention sleep already? </p>

<p> <strong>8) Who's your favorite artist (musical, or whatever)?</strong><br>
  alicia keys, babyface, brian mcknight, boyz II men, a-mei, LAURYN HILL, floetry, mariah carey, jay chou, seven, john legend, missy, and justin timberlake (sometimes). i am in love with jet lee (my childhood hero), tom hanks, robert redford, sandra bullock, denzel washington, and many others. </p>

<p> <strong>9) It's 3am, you're finishing your homework. All of a sudden you're
  craving something. What is it?</strong><br>
  brownie obsession! it could be ramen, pancakes, corn bread, cereal, or hamburger helper. most of the time, i crave hugs. </p>

<p> <strong>10) An extremeley hot person is next to you, but so is a delicious
  hot pastrami sandwich. What do you do?</strong><br>
  play hard to get. if the sandwich wants this, it'll have to come get it. </p>

<p> <strong>11) If your best friend came up to you and said he/she hates you,
  and then proceeds to kick your ass, what would you do?</strong><br>
  let my ass be kicked. actually just lying, i would get FIRE IN MY EYES and do some of those crazy naruto ninja tricks. i will blast him/her off the tree, if we're on a tree that is. wait, my best friend wouldn't tell me he/she hates me. what kind of a question is this jeff?! <br>
