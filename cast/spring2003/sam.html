<B>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
Why wouldn't I get involved with Theatre Rice!?  It's such a great 
organization that I just wanted to be a part of.  As someone who is 
graduating at the end of this semester, this was my last chance to be a part of 
this group that I had wanted to join for years.  I had nothing left to lose 
except my dignity.  And now I learned that dignity is worth losing for a few 
laughs...  :o)~
</font>
<P><B>What did you expect to gain from TR?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
Honestly, I wanted to see what I could do on stage and infest my brain 
with memory after memory of good times.  That way, when I'm old I can tell 
my grandkids all the wonderful stories of my youth and my "dallying" with 
the theatre and those crazy, brilliant people that made it all worthwhile. 
(and then a silent tear will run down my cheek and they'll say, "Aw, 
grandma, I wish I could have met them.  They sound like the bestest people in the 
world." I'll pause, wipe the tear from my cheek and answer, "Yes, why yes, 
they were.")

<P><B>Where do you see yourself in five years?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
In five years, I will be beating myself up for not joining Theatre Rice 
earlier in my college career.
</font>
<P><B>What makes you smile?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
My family, my friends and more: especially my Jenny.  Also, random 
people in their every day lives make me smile.  Like the man who fixed his hair 
in the security camera at the bank, the dog who leaned on its elbow outside of 
a moving truck window, the girl who tripped and hit her head on the pole 
in the moving bus.  And of course, to bite the line from my powder blue 
t-shirt: "Theatre Rice makes me smile."
</font>
<P><B>What are your favorite movies?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
Singin' in the Rain, Casablanca, But I'm a Cheerleader, Bad Girls, Boys 
on the Side, Hackers, Shower, Spirited Away, and That's the Way I Like It.
</font>
<P><B>What do you do after Theatre Rice meetings?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
What do you mean after?  Theatre Rice goes on continually for the 
entire semester...  :o)~ But then, there always is sleeping.  That's always 
nice.  Yes.  Sleeping.  I like that.  It also makes me smile.  I smile in my 
sleep I'm so happy to be sleeping.
