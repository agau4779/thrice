<B>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
The first time I saw Theatre Rice I saw Asian American
issues being presented on stage through comedy. I
thought the show was amazing. Three years later, I
finally had the chance (and the time) to contribute to
and be a part of Theatre Rice, and I jumped at the
opportunity to share my Asian American culture on
stage.

<P><B>What did you expect to gain from TR?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
From Theatre Rice, I expected to gain new friends,
new
understanding, and new experiences. What I ended up
gaining, was new friends, new understanding, new
experiences, and bad grades. The last one was a bonus
that I hadn't expected.

<P><B>What's the craziest thing you've ever done?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
Once I met a crazy Frenchman named Simon, who took me
paragliding in the Swiss mountains. Simon instructed
me by saying "Take big steps down the hill, and when I
say 'run,' run. Today we have to run farther because
there is no wind... ready? go!" and we were off. I
started down the mountain, and suddenly we were at a
mad dash, and I felt my left shoe come off my foot-
but it was too late to pause- I only had time to
scream "my shoe!" before I was running through the
air. What followed was the most peaceful half an hour
of my life. Until Simon decided we had to do
"wingovers" on our way down- it felt like the tiptop
moment on a swing when the ropes aren't holding you
anymore- only we went competely upside down. Crazy?
That was crazy. And I got my shoe back when Simon's
friend Matt picked it up for me.

<P><B>What are your favorite movies?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
The Usual Suspects, Dirty Dancing, Good Will Hunting,
Magnolia, Chicago, Spirited Away (in Japanese), Fight
Club, American Beauty.... and so fourth. 

</font>
<P><B>What do you do after Theatre Rice meetings?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
After my daily Theatre Rice (Comedy Troupe) meetings,
I generally type up notes on things discussed in
meetings and send them to people. Then I go to sleep.
Occassionally I forget that I am a student because I
haven't opened a book in so long.
