<B>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
I have always wanted to get involved in theatre 
since I was in high school. High school drama was 
really cliquish so I always felt really alienated and 
excluded from doing drama in high school. I saw 
Theatre Rice’s crazy flyering on Sproul my first 
semester at Berkeley and I decided to join the group 
without even having seen a show. 
</font>

<P><B>What did you expect to gain from TR?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
I have already gained so much from Theatre Rice in 
terms of skills that I can use in everyday life 
(i.e. performing onstage has greatly improved 
my public speaking abilities). I hope to further 
develop these skills and to gain new ones as well. 
Oh yeah, I’m also looking for a good time every 
Tuesday and Thursday evening.

<P><B>Where do you see yourself in five years?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
Probably still at CAL (“Hi, I’m Chris, and I’m an 
eighth year, undeclared.”) It’d be nice if one 
could make a living as a professional, full-time 
student. But alas, I’ll probably be finally going 
out into the “real world.” Then again, I’ve always 
wanted to go to culinary school, so maybe I’ll be 
over in New York or something (in the kitchen and 
on off-off-off-off Broadway productions). 
</font>

<P><B>Who are your role models?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
Chairman Takeshi Kaga of Kitchen Stadium. It 
has always been my dream to own a Kitchen 
Stadium (with my own army of Iron Chefs), wear 
flamboyant, sequined suits, and to eat fried conger 
eel heads smothered in vanilla ice cream. Aaaaah, 
now that would be the good life. 
</font>

<P><B>What are your favorite movies?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
Currently, my favorite film is Darren Aronofsky’s 
Requiem for a Dream. I also used to be a really 
hardcore Star Wars fan and the ORIGINAL 
trilogy of films still has a place in my heart.
