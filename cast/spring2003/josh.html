<B>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
My friend Joyce, who's a former ricer now, recommended 
that I come check out a meeting. So I showed up but I 
had many doubts...and I left early. Then suddenly,  I made 
up my mind to join 15 minutes later and ran back to sign up 
for an audition. I haven't regreted it since! 
</font>

<P><B>What did you expect to gain from TR?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
I've already gained so many aspects of theatre rice---life 
long friendships, a strong confidence in myself, leadership 
skills, trust, teamwork, lack of sleep, being a better actor, 
theater techniques and making people think, cry, and laugh 
at issues important to all of us.

</font>
<P><B>Where do you see yourself in five years?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
I see myself building up my career in the entertainment
industry as an aspiring actor or model. I've always had
this dream of helping people, and through these outlets, 
I can speak creatively for the unheard  through film, tv,
and whatever medium I can contribute toward the good of the
world. I know that's naive, but that's the type of person
I'm becoming. 

</font>
<P><B>What makes you smile?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
I smile when I experience spontaneous moments with 
people I care about.( I love to watch shooting stars 
and share stories! ) I get thrilled when I come across 
someone I haven't seen in a long time or even going 
on rare trips back to where I grew up--Guam!! I do 
enjoy helping people any way I can...and making 
them smile if they are down. Since I'm a huge fun, 
watching Buffy and Smallville makes me smile a lot too!

</font>
<P><B>Do you have any special talents?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
I can speak in different voices and produce many 
animated facial expressions. I am also a natural at 
drawing freehand, writing poetry, designing graphic 
art and my personal webpage. I know some of my 
native language, which is called Chamorro. I have 
been told my positive attitude and niceness are 
special talents. I guess I heal people with my words.
