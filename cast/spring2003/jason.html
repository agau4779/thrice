<B>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
I had watched a couple TR shows last year and had enjoyed them 
immensely.  
This year I roomed with Alex S. and Bruce, who were in it and I guess 
that's 
what got me interested.
</font>

<P><B>What did you expect to gain from TR?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
I wanted to meet some interesting, new people and, boy, mission 
accomplished.  I also wanted to improve my acting ability - and by 
"improve" 
I mean "have".
</font>

<P><B>Where do you see yourself in five years?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
Perhaps I will be in grad school studying biotech administration.  
Perhaps 
I will be working.  Perhaps I will be in the food service industry.  
Perhaps 
I will be a field hand on an organic farm.

</font>

<P><B>What makes you smile?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
Taking good photos, blueberries, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, graphic 
design, 
my friends, my roommates, my brother, successful bluffing, perceptive 
sarcasm, estoteric references that I understand, irony, individuality, 
ambition, good movies, 502 films, actual postal mail from friends,  
Girls 
who like photography, Girls in general...
</font>

<P><B>What are your favorite movies?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
There more than I can name or probably think of right now.  A few that 
I 
can watch over and ovber again include Gattaca, Dr.Strangelove, Dark 
City, 
Pulp Fiction, and Pleasantville.
