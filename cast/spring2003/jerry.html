<B>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
It was a promise I made to friends that I have been putting off. Aside 
from 
that, I really was hoping to find an extracurricular group on campus 
that I 
had fun with, and Theatre Rice was just that. I also wanted to try out 
acting and performing on stage, which is something I've always had 
interest 
in, but never took the time to persue.

<P><B>What did you expect to gain from TR?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
All I was expecting were good times and a fun outlet that made my life 
a 
bit more interesting than studying all day and night. Now all I do is 
go to 
CT meetings and study. Excellent.... my life is complete =) Also, I 
expected to get closer to some ppl in TR that I've known but not that 
well, 
and I'm really glad I did!

<P><B>Where do you see yourself in five years?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
Ugh, slaving away at my studies in med school hopefully? <shudder> 
We'll 
see how that goes... =) Ha, watch... I'm still a Berkeley undergrad. 
Oh, 
that would be a sad, sad day.
</font>

<P><B>Who are your role models?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
Bruce Cheung. No, don't worry. He doesn't have a knife to my neck.... 
um... 
honestly.. (call... 911...) O_O ;;
No really, my parents are. They're crazy... in a good way =)

</font>
<P><B>What do you do after Theatre Rice meetings??</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
Come home to Theta Rice and talk about skits with my roommates! Then we 
split up by counting off into twos. We get 5 minutes to prepare a skit 
given a word or as a response to some really odd video, and then 
perform. 
Laugh, and repeat til its morning. Ha... you think it's a joke, don't 
you?
