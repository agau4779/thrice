<B>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
To rebel! To waltz! To make a mess! (with other disobedient children.)
</font>

<P><B>What did you expect to gain from TR?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
I expected nothing but ourselves. We're the ones we've been waiting 
for. What do I dream of gaining, however, is a whole other universe.
</font>

<P><B>Where do you see yourself in five years?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
Keep on breathing, keep on creating, in new and defiant ways, and 
always with a full blown sense of humor, keep on dreaming, keep on thinking 
"%$#% it, why not?" and keep on inexhaustibly going for it all.

</font>
<P><B>Who are your role models?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
Miho Hatori is beautiful kicking. Spike Jonze is kicking. Poets Bao Phi 
and 
Ishle Park are kicking. Hip Hop outfit Typical Cats are kicking. Sigur 
Ros 
live is so kicking. David Choe, Dose Green, Picasso, Jaimie Hewlett, 
and 
Justin Bua are kicking. DJ Shadow's U.N.K.L.E. is kicking. Amelie isn't 
real 
but she's kicking. Wong Kar Wai is always kicking. Otis Redding is 
kicking. 
My grandfather, who may be gone, keeps my heart kicking. My friends, 
they're 
all kicking. There's just so so much, everywhere and all around us, how 
can't we find role models?
</font>

<P><B>Do you have any special talents??</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
The ability to ditch class to answer Theatre Rice questions. The 
ability to 
answer the exact same questions I answered last time without realizing 
it. 
The ability to yell UUUUUUPAAAAWEEEEAAAAHT 
EEEEEEEEEERuRuRuRuRuRuRuRuRRRRu 
KRAAaaaaaAaaaAAAPOO with all my heart, all my soul, and with a straight 
face.
