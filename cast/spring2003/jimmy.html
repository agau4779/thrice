<B>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
To share our stories (as Asian Americans) with other Asian Americans in 
hopes of inspiring each other and creating a stronger community of 
support 
and solidarity amongst Asian Americans of different Ethnicities (Yes, 
contrary to popular conception Asian America is very diverse and the 
Asian 
American umbrella label is misleading).  But as Asian Americans, we 
simply 
get no love from mainstream media (Better Luck Tomorrow is only a start 
but 
that too is limited release only available to those who were seeking it 
in 
the first place); our stories, our histories are so silent, only to be 
found 
in the few privileged college campuses that have Asian American history 
books with professors and even then, the resources are tokenistic.  We 
all 
have something to say, to share, so DOO IT because we’re never given 
the 
chance so here’s your chance…

<P><B>Where do you see yourself in five years?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
Even higher (graduate school) education by day, artist 
(theater/writing/poet/comedian) by night.  Either in Film/Creative 
Writing/Ethnic Studies/Education graduate school, teaching English 
abroad or 
at community college, poetry slam circuit, making a movie or on a 
Hawaiian 
beach running my own night cafe and surfing during the day.

<P><B>What makes you smile?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
Talking about the future of Theatre Rice, creating/seeing great ideas 
flourish into something even more amazing, seeing people drunk and 
happy, 
dad/mom/parent playing with their children, being on the verge of 
overcoming 
an obstacle on a video game, a great LOMO, everyone around me dying of 
laughter, knowing/hearing that I have inspired someone, life and its 
funny 
ways.
