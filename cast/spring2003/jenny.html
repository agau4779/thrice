<B>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
I got involved with TR because I thought I had potential in acting, 
that maybe one day, I might pursue a career as an actress.  
TR was a way for me to explore the field of acting and gain 
some experience on the stage.  I found out that there are 
much more to acting than just acting in Theatre Rice.  There 
are people relations, working hard and knowing when to just 
kick back and having some fun.  Although I realize now that 
my potential in becoming an actress is not going to be surfacing 
in this life  =P, I am very humbled by the fellow theatre ricers 
who puts so much on the stage.

<P><B>What did you expect to gain from TR?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
See above.

<P><B>Where do you see yourself in five years??</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
In five years, I will be a budding neurosurgeon. The 
thought of being a neurosurgeon will force me to
cherish the moments while I'm still in Theatre Rice.
</font>

<P><B>Who are your role models?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
Almost everyone I meet becomes my role 
model in one-way or another.  I don't want to
name names in theatre rice, I might make them 
feel embarrassed but they're there.
</font>

<P><B>What are your favorite movies?</B> 
<BR><font color=#6699FF>
I don't have any favorite movies, I mope and get 
depressed after TR meetings and I have no talent.  
But it makes me smile when I think of the silly things 
ricers would do in TR.
