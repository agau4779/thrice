<h4>Year & Major:</h4>
4th / Economics

<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>
3

<h4>Hobbies/Special talents?</h4>

I bake baller brownies with my dad. 

<h4>What is your favorite word or phrase?</h4>
"Lemme Smang it guuuurrrllll" (keep tha jeep ridin')

House, M.D. (seasons 1-4)

<h4>Favorite animal?</h4>
A horse, such as Sarah Jessica Parker

<h4>If you could be featured in a magazine, what kind of magazine would it be and how would you be featured?</h4>
Rolling Stone. It would be a cover story on the other Mark Lee in UC Berkeley. He sings for DeCadence, and the experience probably catapults him into a lucrative record contract. It works out for the best because he appears to be more popular and cheerful than I am anyway. You guys should come watch a Theatre Rice show and a DeCadence show to compare & contrast!

<h4>What are you most excited about TR this semester?</h4>
TR has a lot of quality entertainment in store for you guys, so come check us out! It'll be worth it, I promise.
