I'd probably want to be the feature in a gay-geeky-fashiony magazine that will have me on the cover as the world's most gay-geeky-fashiony person and be so fabulous and amazing that they blew their venture capital on one edition and so that will be the end of that.

<h4>What are you most excited about TR this semester?</h4>
Making great films and having a great time being musical and fabulous with other Ricers!
