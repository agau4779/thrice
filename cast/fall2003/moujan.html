            <font color="blue" size="2"><b>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</b></font><br>


            <font color="black" size="2">I've always loved acting and being on stage. I grew up surrounded by comedy (from my brothers, and from my best friend Mr. TV), but I never had the time to do anything about it during high school. I love making people laugh.

            <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What do you hope to gain from TR?</b></font><br>

            <font color="black" size="2">Acting skills, improv skills and hopefully good friends.

             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What do you like to do in your spare time</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2"> Sleep, sleep and sleep. And when I'm not sleeping, thinking about sleeping or watching Mr. TV. I also play soccer and follow baseball scores for fun (Go Red Sox!).

             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>Who are your role models?</b></font><br>

             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What are your favorite films or t.v. shows?</b></font><br>
