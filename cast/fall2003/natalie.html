            <font color="blue" size="2"><b>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</b></font><br>


            <font color="black" size="2"> I got involved with Theatre Rice because I've always wanted to explore acting and theatre.
            I sort of wanted to do it in high school, but I never could because Drama always conveniently conflicted with my other classes.
            Also, I saw my first Theatre Rice show during my first semester here at Berkeley and had never laughed so hard or felt so happy while watching a show.
            Something about seeing Asian Americans onstage making Asian American jokes struck me.</font><br><br>



            <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What do you hope to gain from TR?</b></font><br>

            <font color="black" size="2">I hope to gain acting skills as well as people skills from TR. TR is the first organization that I
            joined here at Berkeley (besides the ubiquitous Hall Ass) and it's interesting to see how a group of strangers
            (except for returners) bond through theatre or just spending almost all of their time together.
            It's like playing with people and putting them in a situation that (hopefully) ends happily.
            </font><br><br>



             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What do you like to do in your spare time?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2">In my spare time I like to watch films, be a music snob and read album reviews, sleep and dream,
              try new restaurants, cook, take pictures, read, cuddle with my cat (Jackson), and be a nerd and talk on AIM.
              </font><br><br>


             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What are your favorite films or t.v. shows?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2">Films: Election, Batman Returns, City of God, American Beauty, The Sixth Sense, The King and I.
              TV shows: Simpsons, Smallville, SNL
              </font><br><br>


             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>If you had a quote that defines how you live life, what would it be?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2">The good thing about pessimism is that you're either always right or pleasantly surprised. </font><br><br>
