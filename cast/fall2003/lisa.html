            <font color="blue" size="2"><b>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</b></font><br>


            <font color="black" size="2">  They seemed crazy and fun. Also, acting is cool because you can be all
            these people that society would generally prohibit you from being.

             </font><br><br>



            <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What do you hope to gain from TR?</b></font><br>

            <font color="black" size="2">A better understanding of Asian American issues and of myself.


            </font><br><br>



             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What do you like to do in your spare time?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2"> Write. Or look at things and try to see the absolutely bizarre in every setting and situation.


              </font><br><br>


             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What are your favorite films or t.v. shows?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2"> I like a lot of foreign films because they're generally simpler and
             more wholesome than American films. Also, you get a sense of this completely different life out there, a different "reality".


              </font><br><br>


             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>If you had a quote that defines how you live life, what would it be?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2">I have no idea.
