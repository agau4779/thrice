            <font color="blue" size="2"><b>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</b></font><br>


            <font color="black" size="2"> I got involved with Theatre Rice because the idea of presenting Asian American issues through theatre was intriguing to me.

            <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What do you hope to gain from TR?</b></font><br>

            <font color="black" size="2"> By being in Theatre Rice, I hope to learn about the diverse perspective of the issues surrounding Asian Americans. I also love getting to know the cool cats in rice and of course the theatre element is a blast.






            </font><br><br>



             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What do you like to do in your spare time?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2">In my spare time away from Theatre Rice, I mostly study. Cuz I'm a nerd.

             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>If you had a quote that defines how you live life, what would it be?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2">If I had a quote that defines how I live life, it
             would be- "Never do the things you'll regret, but
             never regret the things that you do." or "Do I dare,
             disturb the universe? In a minute there is time for
             decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse."
             or "I'll be back."

             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What message would you give to the future generations of Theatre Rice?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2"> To the future generations of Theatre Rice, remember
             that at the end of the day Rice is just another
             organization. At the same time remember that Rice
             presents you with the amazing opportunity to express
             your artistic talents to address social issues. Strive
             for the best, but don't take yourself too seriously.
