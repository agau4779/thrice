            <font color="black" size="2"> I love self _expression!  And since I can't sing, write GOOD poetry or make anything with my two hands, I find myself deeply involved in displaying my many idiocentric personalities.

            <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What do you hope to gain from TR?</b></font><br>

            <font color="black" size="2">More than anything, I really want to be a part of a very positive and close -  knit  Asian American community.

             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>Who are your role models?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2">There are so many people that I admire and only one person who really inspires me in everything I do, and that's my mama.  She is just a strong, amazing and beautiful pinay that cannot be compared to anyone (corny - I know).

             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What do you like to do in your spare time?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2">In my spare time I love to PAArty (Hang out with my PAAmily), eat my mom's cooking, and sleep.

             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>If you had a quote that defines how you live life, what would it be?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2"> May the bird of paradise lay an egg in your coffee" - This quote, like me, sounds weird and funny - only because it doesn't make any sense.
