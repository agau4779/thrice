            <font color="blue" size="2"><b>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</b></font><br>


            <font color="black" size="2"> I did a lot of theatre back in high school and have been kinda deprived
            of it over the last two years, because my previous school had a conservatory (which meant if you weren't a major, you couldn't do anything)
            and the previous on-campus theatrical group had folded a few years back.  Plus I worked a lot with the Asian and Filipino organizations and
            concluded the following from that experience: Asians are cool.  When I decided to come to Berkeley, I searched around for organizations and found Theatre
            Rice:  Theatre AND Asians.  Wow.  Blew my mind being the sheltered idwesterner that I am.  I hope to be a voice for all sheltered Asianjunior transfer students from Ohio that relocated to California (or am
            I the only one??? *gasp*).

            <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What do you hope to gain from TR?</b></font><br>

            <font color="black" size="2">I hope to become a better performer, and meet some cool people in the
            process (see above... Asians = COOL, Asians + Theater = UBER-COOL).  I hope to gain a better understanding of issues facing the APIA community
            (like Prop 54? NO, really?) and help dispel the myth that Asians aren't a bunch of nerdy overachievers (or maybe we are... hmm...) and that we, too,
            can be entertaining.  Oh yeah, I want to dress as cool as Reggie.  Yeah...

             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What do you like to do in your spare time?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2">Umm... chat with people on AIM, update my Xanga and reading other
             people's blogs, write testimonials on Friendster, ya know... (actually I do! don't laugh...)  For the time being,
             Theatre Rice is soaking up that free time like a nice, flavorful menudo sauce.  I enjoy the occasional night out
             on the town, as well...

             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What are your favorite films or t.v. shows?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2"> The only show I've been really fanatic about is American Idol (yeah,
             along with the rest of America)... I'm Aiken 4 Clay!  I'll admit I'm kind of a
             reality show enthusiast as well. Movies:  Moulin Rouge, Chicago, Requiem for a Dream, and many more...

             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>If you had a quote that defines how you live life, what would it be?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2"> "Come what may."  Life's about taking risks.  Otherwise, I probably
             wouldn't be in California right now.  (oh yeah, and props to my DP peeps back in the nasty 'Nati!)
