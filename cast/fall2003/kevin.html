            <font color="black" size="2">I first saw Theatre Rice perform during Senior Weekend with REACH! and I've been a groupie ever since.  When fall semester came around, their performamce at PASO reminded me that I really wanted to get invovled with ThRice.  The idea of moving your audience with a powerful performance just appeals to me.

            <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What do you hope to gain from TR?</b></font><br>

            <font color="black" size="2"> Through Theatre Rice, I hope to gain the theatre experience I never got in high school.  I wanna be able to think on my feet and express myself in ways that I couldn't before.  I hope to discover and develop my true self.
