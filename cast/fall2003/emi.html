            <font color="blue" size="2"><b>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</b></font><br>


            <font color="black" size="2"> It would seem that my interest in theatre would have sprouted naturally
            from my obsession with films,  but theatre never hit me as something I could do until last summer.
            On a whim, I decided to try theatre in a summer course, and I was completely inspired.
             When I got back to Cal for the fall semester, I really wanted to be a part of a student theatre group – and there was
             Theatre Rice, staring me in the face.  And thus, here I am!

            <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What do you hope to gain from TR?</b></font><br>

            <font color="black" size="2">It’s a strange and exciting sensation, being able to slip into
            characters or roles so different from your own and just playing around with these other selves.
            That aside, he list gets cheeseball, but here goes: more laughs, more fun, more friends, more memories.

             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What do you like to do in your spare time?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2"> My first obsession is art.  After that, the written word.  But for the
             rest of my free time, I have an unhealthy attachment to films, across many a genre, across many a decade.
             There are only two shows worth watching: Gilmore Girls and South Park (though I thoroughly respect the Simpsons).  I have an
             array of favorite books (like Princess Bride) and authors (like Amy Tan, DavidSedaris,Louis Sachar).
             That aside, I’m attempting to build my musical education.  I didn’t consume much music in high school, and I’m trying to catch up.
              Mostly I’m a fan of arious forms of rock: classic rock (Led Zep, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd), pop rock (Red Hot Chili Peppers, Third Eye Blind, Goo Goo Dolls), punk rock
              (White Stripes, the Hives, The Ramones, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Stokes, The Vines), folk rock (Elliot Smith, Simon and Garfunkel, John Mayer), wuss rock (Weezer,
              Coldplay, Oasis, Jimmy Eat World, Ozma, Radiohead), grunge rock (Nirvana), oldies (Beatles), etc.  There are a few electronic artists I appreciate (Moby, Fat Boy Slim).  Many more genres and artists as well; the list goes on


              </font><br><br>


             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What are your favorite films or t.v. shows?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2"> My favorite TV show is easily Gilmore Girls, aka The Best Show No One’s
             Watching.  After that, South Park provides my weekly dose of absurdity and …crude wrongness.
             The favorite film list is much more extensive … it’s horrifically difficult to
             narrow my favorites into a compact list.  Divided by genre:
             Comedy: Monty Python and the Holy Grail, This is Spinal Tap, Princess
             Bride,
             About a Boy
             Drama: Magnolia, Almost Famous, American Beauty, Good Will Hunting,
             Pleasantville
             Romantic Comedy: Amelie, Bridget Jone’s Diary, When Harry Met Sally,
         Annie
         Hall, Sleepless in Seattle
         Dorky Teen Flick: Clueless, Ferris Beulier’s Day Off, Breakfast Club
         Classic: Sabrina, Some Like It Hot, The Apartment, Breakfast at
         Tiffany’s,
         Gold Rush (Charlie Chaplin rocks my socks!)
         Musical: Moulin Rouge, Chicago
         Sci Fi: Gattaca, Contact, Star Wars (The original trilogy, not the
         recent crap)
         Action Trilogy: Indiana Jones, Back to the Future
         Movies for Guys Who Like Movies: Apocalypse Now, Taxi Driver, Pulp
         Fiction

         These are just the basic greats you have to see, but there are several more essentials.
