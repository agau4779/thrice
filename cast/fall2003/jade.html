            <font color="blue" size="2"><b>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</b></font><br>


            <font color="black" size="2">  the creative outlet! TR allows all forms of art to be displayed, and i
            think we've encompassed many of the forms. there's some beautiful things going on in publicity, not to mention the boundless stage.
            woo! plus, i get superstardom across campus as all tread in fear of me. yeah! plus i was threatened by my neighboring costars.
            grar, i hate you people upstairs!



             </font><br><br>



            <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What do you hope to gain from TR?</b></font><br>

            <font color="black" size="2">lifelong friendships. hah, what a corny answer. well, i'm hoping to
            form a jamie espiritu fan club, showcase my variable skills, and fill up that 7-9:30 gap in my life.




            </font><br><br>



             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What do you like to do in your spare time?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2">ah, if i'm not extraordinarily busy with work as a computer lab
             monitor, schoolwork(15 units! egads!), or droning on about Theatre Rice, i lead quite a
             quiet life, occasioned by books and cookies. and yes, i've heard before that i'm a fat girl in a skinny body. so what?!
             ah, yes, i like to throw things at people, preferably from my window. cats work remarkably well. ah, i
             also indulge in histrionic fits. ;D


              </font><br><br>


             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What are your favorite films or t.v. shows?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2">Cowboy Bebop, Simpsons, Trigun, Buffy, friends, Iron Chef, Futurama,
             regret, Salvador Dali, Vincent Van Gogh, Claude Monet, yeah its art, so what? i'm also impressed by Haruki Murakami, stephen hawking, Einstein, and countless
             others. yeah, i have lots of free time. you wanna make something of it?

             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>If you had a quote that defines how you live life, what would it be?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2"> "if i can't serve as a good example, then i can always be a horrible warning"
             -anonymous, or unknown. eh.
