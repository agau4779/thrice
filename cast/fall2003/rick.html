            <font color="blue" size="2"><b>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</b></font><br>


            <font color="black" size="2"> I got involved with Rice because I like to act, I'm Asian American, and
            I was looking to skyrocket to fame and fortune...err..at least partial recognition on campus...and maybe some hot chicks chasing me down after
            the shows.  Oh yeah, and I like to get information about issues I care about on stage.

             </font><br><br>



            <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What do you hope to gain from TR?</b></font><br>

            <font color="black" size="2">I hope to learn and grow as an actor, address subjects that need to be
            addressed, and to establish a great group of friends.  Most importantly, I want to just have a good time.  Also, fame and fortune, but that's kind
            of a side note...or is it?


            </font><br><br>



             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What do you like to do in your spare time?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2">Well, I like to hang out with friends, party hardstop noncore, play
             guitar,write music,poetry, and plays, do Theatre Rice, eat, drink, sleep, do activist stuff, and run around naked.
             I'd say I like to masturbate as well, but I'm not sure if they can say that on the website.



              </font><br><br>


             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What are your favorite films or t.v. shows?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2"> I really like Family Guy, Sealab 2021, the Simpsons, Reno 911!, and I
             used to watch Dawson's Creek to get my weekly Katie Holmes fix.  Fav films would probably be Moulin Rouge (I can't get enough of this movie),
             Zoolander, Requiem for a Dream, Hardcore Anal 4 (Just kidding), and probably a lot of other movies that I can't think of right now.

             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>If you had a quote that defines how you live life, what would it be?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2"> I'd say a couple of quotes kinda define how I live:<br>
             "Rock out with your cock out" - someone drunk. <br>
             "Come what may" - Moulin Rouge, as you just gotta stay true to your heart.<br>
             "Hey, it's Theatre Rick!" - Me, since my life is a nonstop dramatic tragic comedy.<br>
             "..so take off all your clothes" - Nelly, since I get naked a little too frequent for some people's liking.<br>
             "I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard, handful of complaints but I can't help the fact that everyone
             can see these scars"-Linkin Park, yeah, enough said.
