            <font color="blue" size="2"><b>Why did you get involved with Theatre Rice?</b></font><br>


            <font color="black" size="2">I liked the people. I like acting silly. I needed something to do other than homework.

             </font><br><br>



            <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What do you hope to gain from TR?</b></font><br>

            <font color="black" size="2">More friends. Confidence...blah blah blah. Okay fine, I'm just in it for the groupies.
            I'm only kidding of course. I hope to gain experience in speaking in front of people (you kinda need that to be an architect)
            and be able to do whatever I want without worrying about what people think. And also for the groupies. JUST KIDDING.


            </font><br><br>



             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>Who are your role models?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2">Buffy. Oh...you mean a real person? Ok well in that case I'd have to
             say my group of friends up here because all of them are very special and offer something that I can learn from.


              </font><br><br>


             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What are your favorite films or t.v. shows?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2">I was obsessed (and sadly..still am) with Buffy. Hmm...I LOVE Sex and
             the City...and Smallville is cool too. If any of you feel like giving me the boxed dvd sets of any of these shows...
             feel free to do so.



              </font><br><br>


             <font color="blue" size="2"><b>What message would you give to the future generations of Theatre Rice?</b></font><br>

             <font color="black" size="2">If you are scared, you have good reason. Just kidding (or am i?). Just
             have fun, don't sweat it, and don't be scared to make asses out of yourselves.
