<p><strong>1. Why are you doing this?</strong><br>
   ?? =/  What did I do?  Well, why? I'll tell you why!!  Because on one beautiful day while I was walking down lower sproul, I was harassed by some guy--whose name I will not say *ahem* but starts with a K*)--who handed me a Theatre Rice flyer saying, WE NEED YOU!  WE NEED YOU! WE NEED MORE GIRLS!!!"  Simple as that.</p>

<p><strong>2. What makes you special?</strong><br>
   Because I like Se7en and Se7en eats rice just like every other person in the planet.</p>

<p><strong>3. Theatre Rice.  Let's break it down, shall we?  How do you 
feel about theatre?</strong><br>
   I can never get enough of it.</p>

<p> <strong>4. And Rice?</strong><br>
   I need a patch to stop the addiction.</p>

<p> <strong>5. Alright, be honest, how often do you check the
facebook?</strong><br>
   >.< Why must I sayyy????  Well, I don't facebook people, I'd rather people facebook me.  And that's all I'll say.  Let's just say I check it more than once a week =X.  FINE! I'll be honest... I check it more than I breathe.  I'm an expert facebook stalker ^^.</p>

<p> <strong>6. What is/was your favorite cartoon?  why?</strong><br>
   DONALD DUCK because you can never understand what he's saying!  Even Mickey goes *takes on high-pitched helium voice* "Goofy, did you understand a word he said?"</p>

<p> <strong>7. What would you do for a million dollars?</strong><br>
   Lick someone's really dirty, crusty toes even if they havent taken off their shoes in weeks.  And we know how bad that gets folks.  That's why we take off our shoes before we enter the house =P.</p>

<p> <strong>8. What would you pay a million dollars to see other people
do?</strong><br>
   There's nothing in the world that would make me shell out that much money (if i even had it).  However, I do hold a million dollars in Monopoly currency I'm a googlenaire in the Monopoly world.  Actually now that I think about it, I would pay a million dollars to see really funny people Improv for me for the rest of my remaining life and they have to always come up with something new!  The only way you can get my million is if you can make me laugh...forever.</p>

<p> <strong>9. Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the diva-est of them
all?</strong><br>
   That is so Beyonce.  She always steals the limelight.</p> 

<p> <strong>10. Ask an open-ended question.</strong><br>
   Here or There?</p>
