		<answer>I like to play Jazz.  Sadly, I cannot provide vivid descriptions as I haven't touched an instrument in almost a month now and am forgetting what my trombone looks like.  I'm also into travelling a lot.  I divert my student loan funds to travel, by cleverly buying and returning my books each week.

		<answer>Stress balls.  Judging by the name, you would think that they relieve
stress, but instead they add it, because you can never seem to crush the
damn things!  Lesser beings would likely squeeze them until they themselves
would implode
