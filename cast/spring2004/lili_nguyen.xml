		<answer>I like to spend my time making absurd requests, driving my friends nuts with my bi polar tendencies. Sometimes I enjoy going to school to maintain a bit of intellectual decency. I watch SATC. I pretend to be SATC with my fellow cohorts. I pretend to work out, that's kind of fun. Often, I become a hermit and dwell beneath a rock with my school books. Meet me at FSM or Milano's
