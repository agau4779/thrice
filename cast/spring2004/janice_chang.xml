		<number>2</number>
		<answer> yes, many. anything to prevent me from doing homework. i love organizing my closet. jeans and underwear folded in thirds, socks grouped by color, shirts hung in rainbow order and grouped by style, purpose, and texture, long-sleeve tees and pajamas in drawer 2, hats and bags in the crate on top, short sleeve and tank tops neatly folded in the bin under my bed, and shoes ordered by style. i know where everything is. i also love to bake. i once spent so much time making a lemon cheesecake because i had to grate the zest and juice the lemons by hand that i almost threw it away when it was done because i thought it was poisoned (lemon overdose - it gave me a horrible stomachache but everyone else thought it was good). and i enjoy building houses for the less fortunate. while you selfish bastards tumbled down the snowy slopes of north america during winter break, i slaved away in the summer heat of zambia for two weeks, moving cement blocks and pushing wheelbarrows of sand and gravel, eating caterpillars and chihuahua, and battling flies, persistent merchants, and tickle-happy children. one of the best two weeks of my life. looking forward to something similar in chile during the summer. i also enjoy snowboarding, longboarding, rock climbing, doing anything dangerous (except drugs) and being overly critical of myself.  don't you regret asking this question?

		<answer>  the ouija board said 86; the carne asada quesadilla i had today will ensure my brain turns to mad cow-induced tofu at 32. but ideally, i'd like to live until i'm satisfied that i've been a good mother.

		<answer> only enough to buy me a sailboat ($869,438. i'm not that greedy). i'd tell thricebowl that i was buying us a sailboat, take off around the world, and only be seen and heard from through pictures and postcards. of course not.
