  <answer>
   Race is a social construct existing because of the Man. Race can never
   define who I am. Race as an idea should be abolished from the face of the
   Earth. But alas, we live in a world of irony, and identifying myself by race
   is one of the only ways I and others like me can make progress in this
   struggle against the Man. So I must say that I am Asian American.
