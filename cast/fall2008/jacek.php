<p><strong>1) Name?</strong><br />
Jacek!
</p><p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br />
Twenty-ten.  Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, with a potential minor in Math.
</p><p><strong>3) How many semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br />
I wish I could say I'm a Theatre Rice virgin, but... 3.  Don't look at me like that!  I was caught up in the moment, it was purely physical, I swear!
</p><p><strong>4) What are some of your hobbies?</strong><br />
Superheroism, supervillainy.<br>  Also, swimming, surfing, ukulele-ing, partying. 
</p><p><strong>5) What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</strong><br />
I was under the misguided impression that they would reward our performances with asian food.  I had my chopsticks at the ready and everything.  I'm a little disillusioned and hungry now.
</p><p><strong>6) What is your favorite article of clothing?</strong><br />
I'm partial to anything with lapels, really.  And a good pair of jeans.
</p><p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br />
Basically, I love improv, she's my mistress, and this lets me keep doing it (her?) and teaching others to do so.
</p><p><strong>8) Say that in the future you become extremely wealthy.  How would you have most likely come upon this money?</strong><br />
I'll be the CEO of several large corporations.  At the same time.
</p><p><strong>9) Once you have the money, what would you do with it? </strong><br />
Divide and conquer to become the most powerful man on earth.  Then expand into space.
</p><p><strong>10) If you could have any single superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br />
Time travel comes to mind, but I hear it creates all kinds of paradoxes.  I'd stick with telekinesis, that would kick ass.  Imagine what you could do with that... in bed.
</p><p><strong>11) What is your ideal weekend?</strong><br />
See #9.
</p><p><strong>12) What is your favorite type of food?</strong><br />
Polish food is excellent.   Italian food is excellent.  Japanese food is excellent.  Also, I like bananas.
</p><p><strong>13) Which would happen first - pigs flying, or hell freezing over?</strong><br />
Pigs flying, definitely.  I'll be the one strapping it to a rocket.  Voila, cheap missile guidance system.  Then it can parachute off and steal food from my enemies' pigs.
</p><p><strong>14) What is the worst pickup line you've ever heard, or been told?</strong><br />
I've had a girl serenade me in public before, it's incredibly awkward.  But besides that, I hate "come here often?" just because it's so overused and doesn't lead into any reliable topic of conversation, thus resulting in the inevitable, and much despised, awkward pause.
</p><p><strong>15) Name an actor, actress, or other performer who you admire.</strong><br />
I give props to Robert Downey Jr. for Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and, of course, Iron Man.  The guy's nuts, he makes every line sound completely improvised.  And I respect Michael C. Hall from the show "Dexter" for just being incredibly creepy.   Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight was mindblowing of course.  Lastly, Aaron Eckhart is hilarious in Thank You for Smoking.
