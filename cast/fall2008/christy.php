<p><strong>1) Name?</strong><br />
Christy (aka YANGSTA) Yang   :P
</p><p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br />
Junior year!  In the process of declaring IB and maybe english or theatre minor 
</p><p><strong>3) How many semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br />
awesome 3 
</p><p><strong>4) What are some of your hobbies?</strong><br />
Singing, dancing, playing on the Gamecube (super smash anyone? Madden?), Nintendo DS.......people watching 
</p><p><strong>5) What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</strong><br />
After the info session seeing how everyone was so warm and out-of-the-box and insane...I was like....I HAVE to try out!
</p><p><strong>6) What is your favorite article of clothing?</strong><br />
On me? I'd have to say a sexy coat on those chilly winter days.  On men? A suit......always :)
</p><p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br />
Theatre Rice always has a way of allowing anyone and everyone to explore different dynamics of themselves as well as others through multiple media forms, and to me that is very important. I love growing and maturing with Rice
</p><p><strong>8) Say that in the future you become extremely wealthy.  How would you have most likely come upon this money?</strong><br />
Star in a leading role of an insanely epic movie (like The Dark Knight!) and gaining all this press and attention to do more movies, only to turn them down to start my own babysitting center where lovely 3-9 year olds can play around and have fun! 
</p><p><strong>9) Once you have the money, what would you do with it? </strong><br />
Oops...I kind of answered it with the previous question. But yes I'd love to just make little kids laugh. With the rest of my time I'd spend a lot of it on traveling. I feel like being culturally aware of the world nourishes a person's mentality and spirituality, and that's something that people should do hands on (if they have the money!)
</p><p><strong>10) If you could have any single superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br />
The power to understand and speak fluently any language or any type of communication existing in the universe. I feel like networking and relationship building is more powerful that people imagine, and with my ability I could know almost anything I wanted and use that. I'd ask the trees and the animals a TON of questions hahaha.
</p><p><strong>11) What is your ideal weekend?</strong><br />
I miss my family so much....It would be to have a movie night with my siblings and father at home just relaxing and laughing...then do something active the next day like kayaking or rock climbing! And a day with my mom doing everything she loves.
</p><p><strong>12) What is your favorite type of food?</strong><br />
My own version of 'comfort' food hahaa.....meaning home-cooked steak by dad or mom's great veggie stew or regular restaurants that me and my family n friends go to often :) 
</p><p><strong>13) Which would happen first - pigs flying, or hell freezing over?</strong><br />
Pigs flying for sure man! Dude some group of random bored smart people are gonna get together and make this flying strap-on contraption that they can put on the pigs, and voila!  
</p><p><strong>14) What is the worst pickup line you've ever heard, or been told?</strong><br />
OMG "Hey baby, what's your sign?" is SOOOOOO overplayed. Even as a joke. Seriously....cut it out of your dialogue. FOREVER
</p><p><strong>15) Name an actor, actress, or other performer who you admire.</strong><br />
Angelina Jolie
