<p><strong>1) Name?</strong><br />
Erika (Erkaaahhhh) Villalobos (House/City of Wolves) Pallasigue 
</p><p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br />
Year Deux, intended English and/or Psych major with minor in Theatre (but this changes on a weekly basis so it's unreliable information)
</p><p><strong>3) How many semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br />
This would be semester dos.
</p><p><strong>4) What are some of your hobbies?</strong><br />
Taking longs walk on the beach, eating, cooking and then eating whatever I've cooked, reading self-help books, singing church songs, writing, watering my plants, smelling my freshly-laundered clothes, bugging Anthony Cheung, playing with lighters, drinking (water...duh!), mixing drinks (tea...duh!), and gossiping about Theatre Rice members.
</p><p><strong>5) What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</strong><br />
Haha, at first I thought it said, "Who are you attracted to in Theatre Rice?" And then I thought, "Oh, *********** is cute!" Um, but honestly, the fliers were really catchy and one of them got shoved in my face as I was running (yes, running) through Sproul. And well, now I'm here!
</p><p><strong>6) What is your favorite article of clothing?</strong><br />
On myself? Nothing. I like being naked. Just ask my roommates. On others? Nothing. I like other people being naked. But underwear (panties and boxers alike) are pretty amazing things! I mean, goodness, they're like the piece of clothing that no one really sees (cause they're suposed to be underneath your clothes,but some people like them sticking out for the whole world to see), but everyone puts so much value on. Underwear is synonymous to our inner beings. They're under so many layers and yet, they always seem to make their way out.
</p><p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br />
Theatre Rice will enable me to find the perfect boyfriend: artsy, a little pimply, emo, and good at enunciating words. On a more serious note, Theatre Rice will help me to be a more confident person. I want to be able to step even further out of my comfort zone and go where I've never gone before. I believe that Theatre Rice will test my limits as an artist and as a person.
</p><p><strong>8) Say that in the future you become extremely wealthy.  How would you have most likely come upon this money?</strong><br />
I cranked out a few best-sellers, a film here, a play there, and I married a wealthy dude. Or I befriended a really old person, hung out with them and became like the daughter they never had. And then that old person died and ohmygosh they decided to make me sole heir to their fortune, of which I had no previous knowledge of, and well, end of story!
</p><p><strong>9) Once you have the money, what would you do with it? </strong><br />
Buy a jet, travel around the world, buy my friends really cool presents, make my parents retire, send money and balikbayan boxes to the relatives in the Philippines (cause that's what we do!), fund high school theatre groups, construct my own theatre company, open a restaurant, get braces (maybe, cause I kind of like my crooked teeth), get my girl rock band together, take those expensive creative writing classes, and then put the rest in the bank and save for my unborn children's college education.
</p><p><strong>10) If you could have any single superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br />
I would figure out how to make sad people happy. Not get rid of unhappiness altogether, just have the ability to make pain go away, even for just a few moments, enough to make that person realize that happiness still exists. And the truth is, I think I already have that superpower. (:
</p><p><strong>11) What is your ideal weekend?</strong><br />
I wake up, I don't even have to shower cause I'm automatically clean. There's a fresh caramel frappucino (extra caramel and soy milk) ready to be devoured, along with bagels topped with strawberry cream cheese. I'm already energized. I find the perfect outfit without even having to look. My homework is done. My friends come over. I beat everyone at Mario Kart, then we watch hours of Grey's Anatomy. The brownies come out pefect. I snuggle up to read a good book. I sip some wine and play my jazzy music while I think of all the good things in life. I walk on the beach at night with the stars glittering above me and the waves crashing about, lulling me to sleep. Then I make my way back to my warm, comfortable bed, I slide between the sheets, and sleep comes so easily to me and I already begin dreaming of something wonderful.
</p><p><strong>12) What is your favorite type of food?</strong><br />
Anything I can digest...which, in the past, included live guppies. So...yeah, anything. Except banana-flavored anything. I like bananas,but I can't stand things that taste like them.
</p><p><strong>13) Which would happen first - pigs flying, or hell freezing over?</strong><br />
Pigs flying. And then I would jump on one and fly through the air, steering by grabbing on to their ears. Then they'd squeal. Hell freezing over is too boring.
</p><p><strong>14) What is the worst pickup line you've ever heard, or been told?</strong><br />
Person A: Can I have your picture? Person B: Why? Person A: So I can send it to Santa so he'll know exactly what I want for Christmas!
</p><p><strong>15) Name an actor, actress, or other performer who you admire.</strong><br />
Audrey Hepburn, Vivien Leigh, and Carey Grant. The classic stars of black and white film, the epitome of real Hollywood actors.
