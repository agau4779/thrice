<p><strong>1) Name?</strong><br />
Jeff Uchida
</p><p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br />
Junior; English
</p><p><strong>3) How many semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br />
1 previous semester
</p><p><strong>4) What are some of your hobbies?</strong><br />
I like to play the guitar, watch TV, listen to music, browse the internet, play video games, read little bit of this and that and walk around the city.
</p><p><strong>5) What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</strong><br />
The idea of a community of friends acting and putting on performances for the public peaked my interest for Theatre Rice.
</p><p><strong>6) What is your favorite article of clothing?</strong><br />
I love jackets. They make great blankets on cold nights.
</p><p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br />
Theatre Rice will help me achieve my goal of performing and making people smile.
</p><p><strong>8) Say that in the future you become extremely wealthy.  How would you have most likely come upon this money?</strong><br />
This great fortune that you speak of will have come to me in a dream. It will tell me the numbers to a super lotto jackpot. Oh yeah, you wait and see! It'll happen... some day soon.
</p><p><strong>9) Once you have the money, what would you do with it? </strong><br />
I'd probably pay back people and pay the bills. Yeah I know. It's a boring answer, but what can I say? I like to think practically.
</p><p><strong>10) If you could have any single superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br />
At one time in my life, I would have wanted the power to read minds. But then I thought to myself how terrible that is. People have private thoughts for a reason. I don't need to know what someone thinks of me. It's a bit selfish, in my honest opinion. So I decided I'd want to fly. It's definitely a lot cheaper than buying gas for your car or buying a plane ticket. Plus, you don't have to worry about the security check points. Just be careful of restricted airspace.
</p><p><strong>11) What is your ideal weekend?</strong><br />
If money weren't an issue, I'd love to go to Las Vegas or Disneyland with a bunch of friends and cut lose.
</p><p><strong>12) What is your favorite type of food?</strong><br />
Italian food is awesome.
</p><p><strong>13) Which would happen first - pigs flying, or hell freezing over?</strong><br />
I'd love to see pigs fly. Hell freezing over could cause the Earth to spin out of orbit and, ultimately, causing the the end of civilization as we know it.
</p><p><strong>14) What is the worst pickup line you've ever heard, or been told?</strong><br />
Sheesh, I don't know. There are so many bad pick up lines out there. How could I chose just one? Hmm... the next time you're at a bar and you find yourself interested in a pretty lady, do not, I repeat, DO NOT say to her, "Hey baby let me rock your world... from the back seat of my car!"
</p><p><strong>15) Name an actor, actress, or other performer who you admire.</strong><br />
I really admire Simon Pegg. His work on the show, Spaced, was genius!
