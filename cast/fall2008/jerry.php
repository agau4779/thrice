<p><strong>1) Name?</strong><br />
Jerry Lee
</p><p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br />
Second and I don't know
</p><p><strong>3) How many semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br />
Going for a third semester
</p><p><strong>4) What are some of your hobbies?</strong><br />
Singing in the shower, playing video games I'm good at, manly anime, dancing when no one is looking, doodling, childrens card games, basketball, hanging out with and making fun of my friends and their mannerisms,
</p><p><strong>5) What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</strong><br />
To quote what I wrote for the TR questionnaire two semesters ago,"I was expecting the meetings to involve a showing of a movie and free rice related snacks.
Boy was I pissed when I learned I was wrong."<br>I guess I'll stand by what I said back then.
</p><p><strong>6) What is your favorite article of clothing?</strong><br />
Shorts. Basketball shorts. Very comfortable. Try it. You're gonna like the way you look. I guarantee it. 
</p><p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br />
To quote my second semester questionnaire, "I'll tell you once I figure out what my goals are." Haha it's sad to think that my answer now is exactly the same as it was a semester ago.
</p><p><strong>8) Say that in the future you become extremely wealthy.  How would you have most likely come upon this money?</strong><br />
According to my friend who is currently sitting next to me, "You're on a plane and it crashes and you save this nice rich girl from the wreckage and she falls for you and you marry her and you get rich."<br>That's exactly what she said.
</p><p><strong>9) Once you have the money, what would you do with it? </strong><br />
Buy nice things for my friends and family for giving me so much happiness. And then probably donate a bunch to this worldwide youth group I was apart of during high school. Or maybe just buy a bunch of useless junk.
</p><p><strong>10) If you could have any single superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br />
I used to want to be able to fly or stop time. But now I think the power to enter and manipulate dreams would be cool. I could help people with nightmares, my power would only be limited by my imagination, and it could be a great way to play pranks on people.
</p><p><strong>11) What is your ideal weekend?</strong><br />
Hanging out with the people who make me happy. 
</p><p><strong>12) What is your favorite type of food?</strong><br />
I like everything. Don't make me choose.
</p><p><strong>13) Which would happen first - pigs flying, or hell freezing over?</strong><br />
Pigs flying. A chicken cannon has been invented...
</p><p><strong>14) What is the worst pickup line you've ever heard, or been told?</strong><br />
It's a tie between "Hi, my name is Jerry Lee" and  "I lost my phone number, can I have yours?" The first one is self explanatory. The second one makes no logical sense. I mean, how would having someone else's phone number help?
</p><p><strong>15) Name an actor, actress, or other performer who you admire.</strong><br />
You know that one dude in that one movie. Yeah him and that actress who played opposite him. They're really good.
