<p><strong>1) Name?</strong><br />
Catherine Wang
</p><p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br />
Second, chemical biology and art.
</p><p><strong>3) How many semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br />
My first.
</p><p><strong>4) What are some of your hobbies?</strong><br />
Walking in the rain, ringtoss, looking at pretty things, building forts, listening to Europop when I'm driving to make it feel like I'm driving faster than I'm actually going, pouring water out my screenless window.
</p><p><strong>5) What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</strong><br />
Jerry Lee and the way "theatre" is spelled "theatre" instead of theater.
</p><p><strong>6) What is your favorite article of clothing?</strong><br />
Socks. They come in about a gazillion colours and patterns. You can make monkeys with them and they keep your feet warm and toasty. There's no such thing as a bad sock...unless of course it's neon purple with silver horseshoes and Hannah Montana's face stitched on.
</p><p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br />
To help me get over my fears, make new friends, and be happy. :)
</p><p><strong>8) Say that in the future you become extremely wealthy.  How would you have most likely come upon this money?</strong><br />
As a treasure hunter. Diving in a sea of garbage until I find the magical "X." And then when I do, I'd exclaim loudly "EUREKA!" and sell the treasure to those who can't find their own.
</p><p><strong>9) Once you have the money, what would you do with it? </strong><br />
Give it to my family and friends, buy a time machine, and then travel around the world.
</p><p><strong>10) If you could have any single superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br />
I would say time travel, but I can already do that (see question above). I guess it would be cool to be invisible, but not in the creepy Clay Aiken way.
</p><p><strong>11) What is your ideal weekend?</strong><br />
To drive to Alaska (or Antarctica for that matter) to see the Northern lights.
</p><p><strong>12) What is your favorite type of food?</strong><br />
Pasta, lemon flavoured, and gummi-beared, but not combined all together, that would be gross.
</p><p><strong>13) Which would happen first - pigs flying, or hell freezing over?</strong><br />
Pigs flying because if hell froze over the pigs would be frozen along with hell. On the other hand, I guess if they were good pigs they would be in heaven and not freeze with hell, but then again they probably wouldn't need the wings to fly in heaven anyway because I've always heard that things kind of just hover/glide on clouds up there.
</p><p><strong>14) What is the worst pickup line you've ever heard, or been told?</strong><br />
"There must be something wrong with my eyes because I can't take them off you."
</p><p><strong>15) Name an actor, actress, or other performer who you admire.</strong><br />
Peter Sarsgaard, James McAvoy
