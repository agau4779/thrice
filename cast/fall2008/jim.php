</p><p><strong>8) Say that in the future you become extremely wealthy.  How would you have most likely come upon this money?</strong><br />

Depending on how much money I had, I would save enough to live comfortably and ensure a good retirement/college fund for any possible tykes, I would in all seriousness consider donating the rest to some charitable cause.

Having magical powers ala Gandalf would be pretty freakin' sweet.

I don't know. Realistically, a very relaxing weekend that included martial arts, relaxing with a good book, and spending some quality time with the homies sounds good to me.

Ideally, a weekend romp through Middle Earth would be awesome.
