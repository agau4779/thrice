<p><strong>1) Name?</strong><br />
Varun Rajan
</p><p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br />
First year, and probably business, but that's subject to change
</p><p><strong>3) How many semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br />
My first one!
</p><p><strong>4) What are some of your hobbies?</strong><br />
Acting, dancing, telling funny jokes, making funny faces and voices
</p><p><strong>5) What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</strong><br />
I ate a lot of rice back home before coming to college.  In fact, I 
ate rice every day.  But now that I'm in college, I need to get as 
much rice as I can.  Long story short, I plan to live on Rice for as 
long as possible.
</p><p><strong>6) What is your favorite article of clothing?</strong><br />
Pants.  Gotta love pants
</p><p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br />
It's definitely going to help me express myself and work creative 
juices I probably wouldn't have an opportunity to have fun with 
otherwise. I really think it'll loosen me up and I'm proud to use 
whatever I have to be a part of something bigger than myself.
</p><p><strong>8) Say that in the future you become extremely wealthy.  How would you have most likely come upon this money?</strong><br />
I throw a very inexpensive birthday party, invite everyone I have 
ever met and accept "excessive cash gifts only."
</p><p><strong>9) Once you have the money, what would you do with it? </strong><br />
 I would probably start a charity or a non-profit hospital, and use 
some of the money to campaign for contributions and donations.
</p><p><strong>10) If you could have any single superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br />
Read people's thoughts.  It would make life a hell of a lot easier 
to know what people were thinking and what to say or do or whom to 
avoid accordingly.
</p><p><strong>11) What is your ideal weekend?</strong><br />
Spending time with friends and family, no matter where or doing 
whatever.  As long as I get to end each day in the evening walking 
my dog.
</p><p><strong>12) What is your favorite type of food?</strong><br />
Rice.
</p><p><strong>13) Which would happen first - pigs flying, or hell freezing over?</strong><br />
We have cannons for pigs.  We don't have enough ice for hell.
</p><p><strong>14) What is the worst pickup line you've ever heard, or been told?</strong><br />
Hey baby, guess what has 160 teeth and holds back the incredible 
hulk? My zipper.
</p><p><strong>15) Name an actor, actress, or other performer who you admire.</strong><br />
Bill Cosby, Michael Jackson, Dave Chappelle, James Brown, and there 
are a whole list of others that I should mention but those were just 
the first two dancers and comedians that came to mind :)
