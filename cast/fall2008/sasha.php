Second year, and no idea.
</p><p><strong>3) How many semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br />
This is my first!
</p><p><strong>4) What are some of your hobbies?</strong><br />
Learning Chinese, riding my bike, reading, looking at art, listening to music.
</p><p><strong>5) What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</strong><br />
Joy "J" Reg did... she invited me on Facebook, and I said, "What the hell, why not?" and I've been loving it ever since.
</p><p><strong>6) What is your favorite article of clothing?</strong><br />
These amazingly comfortable brown leather sandals that I got at a thrift store for two freaking dollars! Score!
</p><p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br />
I hope it will help fulfill my goals of improving my ability to think on my feet, and stepping up to new challenges spontaneously, and having a total blast.
</p><p><strong>8) Say that in the future you become extremely wealthy.  How would you have most likely come upon this money?</strong><br />
Writing the next great American novel.
</p><p><strong>9) Once you have the money, what would you do with it? </strong><br />
Buy my parents a mansion, then me, then put away money for my kids for college and for me for world-traveling... and then, of course, donate to the less fortunate.
</p><p><strong>10) If you could have any single superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br />
Mind-reading, OBVIOUSLY. All the other superpowers suck. Mind-reading would be the most fun AND the most useful. Selective mind-reading, though, of course. I really don't care what the majority of you think about all day.
</p><p><strong>11) What is your ideal weekend?</strong><br />
The best weekends are different from all other preceding weekends, and the very nature of that makes it impossible to predict. But I can guarantee that no homework would be involved.

Mac and cheese.
