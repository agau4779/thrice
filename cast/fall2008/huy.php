First semester
</p><p><strong>4) What are some of your hobbies?</strong><br />
Filming, writing, wasting time
</p><p><strong>5) What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</strong><br />
I really enjoy being around so many talented people who are all supportive of each other.
</p><p><strong>6) What is your favorite article of clothing?</strong><br />
My dress-shirt, when I get a chance to wear it.
</p><p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br />
I hope to make some kickass movies with fellow Ricers and exploit their talents :)
</p><p><strong>8) Say that in the future you become extremely wealthy.  How would you have most likely come upon this money?</strong><br />
Most likely I would have risked my life to save a kajilionnaire, who ends up dying anyway but bequeath me his entire estate out of gratitude.
</p><p><strong>9) Once you have the money, what would you do with it? </strong><br />
I would probably buy ILM and the rights to the Star Wars franchise, then do a "reboot" trilogy that will completely ignore the prequel movies. Hell, I'll probably buy the Indiana Jones franchise too just because of Kingdom of the Crystal Bullshits.
</p><p><strong>10) If you could have any single superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br />
I want to be able to see myself the way other people see me. It's a great way to keep yourself objective.
</p><p><strong>11) What is your ideal weekend?</strong><br />
I'd love to be able to spend time working on a film or writing a script, and actually get something done.
</p><p><strong>12) What is your favorite type of food?</strong><br />
Sushi! Actually, if it's raw I'll probably eat it.
</p><p><strong>13) Which would happen first - pigs flying, or hell freezing over?</strong><br />
Probably pigs flying, because you just know there's somebody out there dying to put a rocket pack on a pig just to see it take off.
</p><p><strong>14) What is the worst pickup line you've ever heard, or been told?</strong><br />
"Quick! Give me your phone # before I change my mind!"
</p><p><strong>15) Name an actor, actress, or other performer who you admire.</strong><br />
Probably Will Smith.
