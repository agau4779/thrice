<br><br><h4>How long have you been in Theatre Rice, and what do you like most about it?</h4>
This is my fifth semester in Theatre Rice (seventh if you count the summer shows). I love the aspect of family and performing on stage (even though it still gives me the heebie-geebies). 

<br><br><h4>List your 5 favorite actors/actresses.</h4>
Kevin Spacey (the impressions, man...) <br> Yue Tu (legend... keep waiting for it...) <br> Barack Obama (first politician to always know his audience and be cool about it) <br> Rowan Atkinson (the only man that can be stupid and awkward to smart and witty) <br> Kathleen Mendoza (high school buddy)

<br><br><h4>List your 5 favorite musicians.</h4>
Robert Grant (using his great musicianship skills for God) <br> Derek Tam (virtuoso pianist and friends since middle school) <br> Patricia Heller (fantastic violinist, my inspiration to continuing and developing myself in music) <br> Victor Borge (mixing comedy in music) <br> Dad (all of the above)

<br><br><h4>Say it's the future, and you can genetically splice in a gene from any animal or plant into your own DNA.  What would you choose?  Why?</h4>
Jellyfish.
