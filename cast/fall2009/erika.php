<br><br><h4>How long have you been in Theatre Rice, and what do you like most about it?</h4>
This is my....let's see, 1, 2, 3rd semester in Rice? Yeah, I think it's my 3rd. No, it's my 4th! 
<br>
What I like most about Theatre Rice is the bondage. We become so close to one another. I mean, when we're climbing The Tree at Willard Park, we cling on to one another, literally, for support and I think that's what Theatre Rice is all about, having one another to fall back. And plus, it's a lot of fun being able to act like a kid, playing theater games with one another, laughing and just having a good time. My closest friends have come from Theatre Rice and I have found my family there. There is not one person in Rice that I don't love, like seriously.  Theatre Rice love is the best kind of love: it's unconditional, supportive, and hilarious.

<br><br><h4>Say it's the future, and you can genetically splice in a gene from any animal or plant into your own DNA.  What would you choose?  Why?</h4>
I would choose to splice in a duck gene. Maybe I'll grow feathers and even wings so I can fly. Can ducks fly? Some ducks can fly, I think. Well I would be a duck that can fly. I'd be one of those  yellow ducks and I think the wings and a few feathers would be all I want to get from a duck. I'd like to keep the rest of my normal body, thank you very much. And why? Because I love ducks. They're my favorite animal. Maybe my feathers will make me softer and people will want to cuddle up next to me. 


<br><br><h4>Favorite Fruit?</h4>
Mango. Yummy yummy juicy mango.
