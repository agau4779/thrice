<br><br><h4>How long have you been in Theatre Rice, and what do you like most about it?</h4>
This will be my 3rd semester in Rice. I love the people in Rice. I like that in the course of one semester some 30 odd people can become great friends and create amazing performances.


<br><br><h4>List your 5 favorite actors/actresses.</h4>
Daniel Day-Lewis <br> Natalie Portman <br> Gregory Peck <br> Kate Winslet <br> Ricky Gervais 


<br><br><h4>List your 5 favorite musicians.</h4>

<br><br><h4>Say it's the future, and you can genetically splice in a gene from any animal or plant into your own DNA.  What would you choose?  Why?</h4>
I'd want to be combined with a cheetah. As a part-cheetah being, I'd be very lean and run fast, enabling me to hunt for my own food. But I guess that would make me a part endangered species....oh well.


<br><br><h4>Favorite Fruit?</h4>
Watermelon
