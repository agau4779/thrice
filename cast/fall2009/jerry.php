<br><br><h4>Say it's the future, and you can genetically splice in a gene from any animal or plant into your own DNA.  What would you choose?  Why?</h4>
A Turtle. And then I will be one step closer to my ultimate goal in life: becoming a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. But, alas, this semester is also the semester when I am no longer a teenager. So I guess it would be one step closer to my next goal in life: becoming an Adult Mutant Ninja Turtle.
