<br><br><h4>How long have you been in Theatre Rice, and what do you like most about it?</h4>
This is my 6th semester now. What do I love? Well there's got to be a darn lot for me to keep coming back!<br>
It honestly changes each semester:<br>
1: TR gives you a chance to shine as yourself. <br>
2: TR gives you the chance to meet some of the best friends you'll ever have.<br>
3: TR really challenges you to grow as an actor and person<br>
4: TR provides some of the best times you'll remember.<br>
5: TR never ceases to surprise you. Two words: Stimulus. Package.<br>
6: We'll see what it'll be for this semester. =)

<br><br><h4>Say it's the future, and you can genetically splice in a gene from any animal or plant into your own DNA.  What would you choose?  Why?</h4>
I'd say either a Ninetails or Phoenix.<br>
I guess I'd want something a little majestic, pure; I think both those animals seem to encompass that. I hope it would add to my grace, since at the moment, its at zero. haha.<br>
-- A phoenix also because I've always always always wanted to fly.=) 

<br><br><h4>Favorite Fruit?</h4>
I love Mangoes forever.
