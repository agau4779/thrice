Definitely a seasoned Ricer, I've been in TR for almost 3 whole years now!<br>
What I love about this group is the amazing family dynamic and overall spirit. There are so many inspiring individuals that I can learn from here, and we all connect to form one cohesive entity. <br>
Plus there is always fun to be had at TR socials :P<br>


<br><br><h4>List your 5 favorite actors/actresses.</h4>
<em>Angelina Jolie</em>- because she's sexy as hell to me and always reinvents herself so well to fit her roles.
<br>
<em>Amy Adams</em>- I like all her movies (some definitely more than others) and think she has a whimsical spirit about her.
<br>
<em>Johnny Depp</em>- He is an artist
<br>

um....yeah actually I don't follow actors/actresses that much so...that's all I have :)

<br><br><h4>Say it's the future, and you can genetically splice in a gene from any animal or plant into your own DNA.  What would you choose?  Why?</h4>
Hahahhaa hella people would alter themselves so they're constantly high.<br>

I would take keen eyesight and the octopus' ability to remember everything they learn and retain it forever. (I have strong short term memory but long term is eh.)

mango
