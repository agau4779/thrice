<br><br><h4>How long have you been in Theatre Rice, and what do you like most about it?</h4>
I've been doing Theatre Rice for one and a half years. As of right now, this would make it my second year of Rice. Wow, 4 semesters. Not bad for a transfer student, right? 
<br>
What I love most about TR are all the friends I've made and also the opportunity to try new things. I've mostly done improv, but last semester, I tried my hand at a dramatic scripted piece. TR allowed me to try something new in a creative and nurturing environment.

<br><br><h4>Say it's the future, and you can genetically splice in a gene from any animal or plant into your own DNA.  What would you choose?  Why?</h4>
Shark: 2 reasons. The first being able to use gills to breathe underwater. The second reason is to be a great hunter. I also think they're cool but I only promised 2 reasons, so ignore the last bit. Shark.
