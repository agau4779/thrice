<br><br><h4>How long have you been in Theatre Rice, and what do you like most about it?</h4>
1 semester. I like the laid-back yet productive atmosphere. It has helped me learn a lot of things while having fun. TR helped me build confidence, learn more about time management (very vital!) etc, etc, [INSERT OTHER GREAT STUFF] and of course picking up new friends along the process is the best part.

<br><br><h4>Say it's the future, and you can genetically splice in a gene from any animal or plant into your own DNA.  What would you choose?  Why?</h4>
This is so hard! I guess i would splice the gene that makes lizards camouflage against their surroundings becuase that would be the closest to being invisible and I can't think of anything else cool. Maybe an unlimited supply of teeth (like sharks have, but just one row at a time) so that I could eat awesome crunchy food in old age and still look hot.


<br><br><h4>Favorite Fruit?</h4>
CHEESE (if cheese were a fruit), otherwise super-ripe persimmons.
