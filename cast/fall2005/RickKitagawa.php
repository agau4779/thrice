<p><strong>1. why rice?</strong><br>

   Because I was sucked in 2.5 years ago, and haven't been able to let go
since. Plus, we've consistently had a sexy cast since I've joined, so why
would I give that up?</p>
  

<p><strong>2. why you?</strong><br>

   Ha! Why not me?</p>


<p><strong>3. life outside of rice?  what do you do?</strong><br>

   There's life outside of rice? Oh, are you talking about school, painting,
guitar, slam poetry, writing plays, making films, playing videogames,
reading, making comics, skateboarding, cooking, drinking good beer,
designing clothes, modeling, and hanging out with my girlfriend? No? Oh,
well, nothing then.</p>
 

<p> <strong>4. Britney or xtina?  why?</strong><br>

   Britney has "Toxic," and Christina looks scary sometimes, but Britney is
also married and Christina (I think) is still all skanky and single, so if I
had to support one, I'd go with Xtina.</p>
 

<p> <strong>5. elaborate on the meaning of life.</strong><br>

   Doing what makes you happy and loving someone that loves you just as much.
That's it.</p>
 

<p> <strong>6. GPA?  as in Greatest Personal Achievement?</strong><br>

   a) shooting a commercial that's actually been shown on TV (Heald Business
College anyone?)
b) writing, acting, and directing in NSU's Culture Nights,
or
c) surviving a year of Producing Theatre Rice.</p>

 

<p> <strong>7. Most embarassing moment?  ever?</strong><br>

   I've walked naked down Shattuck, passed out in a dress and woke up in normal
clothes, and have worn a Hawaiian shirt to a funeral. Nothing really
embarasses me. Oh wait, maybe when I pissed myself while I was sleeping when
I was in high school because I had a dream I was standing in front of a
urinal. Yup.</p>
 

<p> <strong>8. who would you never kill?</strong><br>

   I'd kill anyone depending on the circumstances. For instance, if I had to
kill someone because they were brain dead, I'd do it.</p>
 

<p> <strong>9. (bonus) favorite lord of the rings character and why?</strong><br>

   I would say Legolas, just cuz he's badass in the movies, but I have to go to
Sauron. That fool started out at Melkor's bitch, then goes and becomes one
badass mofo that nearly takes over Middle Earth twice. Twice. How many times
has Legolas nearly taken over Middle Earth? That's right. None.</p>
