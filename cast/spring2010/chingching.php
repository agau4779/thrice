<h4>If you were an action movie hero, what would be your weapon of choice, and what clothes would you wear?</h4>
I would be Wolverine because he's just that awesome and I wouldn't need weapons because my weapons would be a part of me anyway although maybe a magnetic-field-disabling device would be helpful in case I bump into people like Magneto who try to control me which is not fun, at all. And of course I'd stick to the underwear-over-tight-suits ensemble because that's the requirement for pretty much all action movie heroes. No capes though. Absolutely NO CAPES.
