<h4>Name?</h4>
Sidney Dritz

<h4>Year & Major?</h4>
First year, english major

<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>
this is my first!

<h4>If you were an action movie hero, what would be your weapon of choice, and what clothes would you wear?</h4>
Weapon of choice... something I could wear as jewelry--a necklace with a long, stong chain and a concealed blade, maybe. I think I'd end up wearing a lot of disguises, so no real set outfit. Lots of black jeans.

<h4>Name a song or artist you like that you wish more people knew about.</h4>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb8dnTng1R8">Happy New Year -Camera Obscura</a>


<h4>Name some actors/artists who inspire you.</h4>
Joey Comeau and Jay Brannan inspire me because they both have used the internet to its best advantage, finding an audience for their work without compromising what that work is by going outside traditional channels to promote themselves.<br>

Sandra Bullock I just love. It's uncomplicated like that. She has the best speaking voice of just about anyone anywhere ever, and every time I see her act she makes me smile.
