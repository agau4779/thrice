<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>

<h4>If you were an action movie hero, what would be your weapon of choice, and what clothes would you wear?</h4>
Definitely an exacto knife and a bunch of utility knives. After cutting cross-sections of bell-peppers and candy bars for Environmental Design 1, I would be wearing black because I want to play the architect (architects love to wear black!) who wants to save the world from bad urban design decisions! Hah, SLICE!


<h4>Name a song or artist you like that you wish more people knew about.</h4>
Definitely Epik High... this rap group knows how to show the human emotions that everybody goes through. Here's two of my favorite songs from them: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx3t1bFg0_0">Maze</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUPznz-pe-0">Map the Soul</a>.

<h4>Name some actors/artists who inspire you.</h4>
Artists? Architect Santiago Calatrava ( a civil engineer and an architect at the same time!) inspires me a lot due to his structural expressionism he places in his work. <br>
