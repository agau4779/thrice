<h4>Name?</h4>
Natalie Friess

<h4>Year & Major?</h4>
Sophomore, Public Health

<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>
This is my first semester

<h4>If you were an action movie hero, what would be your weapon of choice, and what clothes would you wear?</h4>
My weapon of choice would be the genetic mutation that allows
Waterbending. (For those who haven’t seen Avatar: The Last Airbender, you
should check it out.) Abilities which come with Waterbending include
creating ice, walking on water, controlling the tides, being supercharged
by a full moon, healing wounds and controlling people by "bending their
blood". I wouldn’t wear any special outfit to denote my awesome power
though. That way it would be easier to sneak up on people too ;) If
special clothes were require to attain/retain this power, I would wear a
midnight blue sleeveless tunic, a black belt, black tights and black
boots.
