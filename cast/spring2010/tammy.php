<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>
Just this one!

<h4>If you were an action movie hero, what would be your weapon of choice, and what clothes would you wear?</h4>
I'd wear something really ridiculous, like a penguin costume. That way baddies would feel even more embarrassed after they've been beaten down by my trusty mop. 

<h4>Name a song or artist you like that you wish more people knew about.</h4>
So recently I've been listening to a lot of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4KPVx4d8i8">Joanna Wang</a>. Have also been really into <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDIzMGh94vo"> this one Weezer song</a>. My tastes change a lot though so this is probably gonna be out of date pretty fast.

<h4>Name some actors/artists who inspire you.</h4>
Vienna Teng! She was a Computer Science major at Stanford, worked at Cisco, and then quit her job to become a singer/songwriter. I gotta give mad respect right there.
