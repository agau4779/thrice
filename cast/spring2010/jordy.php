<h4>If you were an action movie hero, what would be your weapon of choice, and what clothes would you wear?</h4>
I would use some kind of nifty sonic pistol that knocked people out with a blast of directed sound. Then I would get screwed by the echo in the climactic infiltration scene. As for clothes, I would probably wear a leather jacket, cause they're stereotypically cool like that.


<h4>Name a song or artist you like that you wish more people knew about.</h4>

<h4>Name some actors/artists who inspire you.</h4>
I meant Martin Sheen last semester. Not Charlie Sheen.
