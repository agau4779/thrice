<h4>Name:</h4>
Tiffany Chiao

<h4>Year & Major:</h4>
4th, English

<h4>What attracted you to join Theatre Rice? What makes you stay in it?</h4>
I've always harbored some fondness for the stage and acting, but never thought of actually doing it. In my junior year, though, I decided I wanted to have fun and make friends and gave it a try, choosing TR because of the Asian-American aspect. I stay because TR is one of the few clubs/organizations I've encountered that emphasizes the cast as a family and has members who are genuinely friendly and want to be there, and because it makes me happy.

<h4>Favorite Fruit?</h4>
Watermelon, grapes, rose apples, dragon fruit, etc.

<h4>Hobbies? Special talents?</h4>
I used to make rock sculptures and poorly crafted jewelry. I can flip my eyelids and do a handstand. I enjoy reading, flossing, listening to depressing songs, sleeping in, doodling, and making picspams only I see.

<h4>Movies or TV shows that you enjoy?</h4>
Supernatural, South Park, Star Trek, Kill Bill, and Pan's Labyrinth.

<h4>Music genres or artists you like?</h4>
Indie & obscure.

<h4>Anything else?</h4>
?(´?`)? Nope!
