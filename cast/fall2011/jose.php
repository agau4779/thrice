i wrestle bears in my spare time. i've solved world hunger on multiple occasions, but no one ever has the right price to pay for my solution. i have attempted to overthrow the government once every year for the last 5 years. i have been successful 6 out of those 5 times. i once fist fought against mike tyson. i chose the round i knocked him out in. i <3 TR (but don't tell them. i don't want them getting the wrong idea >_>). i have scaled Mount Olympus and was crowned king by Zeus himself. i felt bad and gave it back to him. i don't need to Watch The Throne. i have Jay-Z and 'Ye doing that for me already. i told Obama to pass the Bailout as a joke. He took it seriously (sorry guys...). i'm the only person to ever see Russia from my Doorstep (i live in Berkeley. so that alone is a testament to my amazing vision.) i can move planets, in fact I'm doing it right now.
