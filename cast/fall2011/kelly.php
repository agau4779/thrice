<h4>What attracted you to join Theatre Rice? What makes you stay in it?</h4>
I think that TR alum said it the best, "Theatre Rice is more than just a family. It's a identity." I originally joined Theatre Rice because I wanted to act and be on stage, but Theatre Rice has given me a family and a community that I could not imagine my college years without. Now, I stay in Theatre Rice not just because I enjoy performing, but because Theatre Rice has become a part of me and I hope to give back to Theatre Rice as much as it has given to me.
