<h4>What attracted you to join Theatre Rice? What makes you stay in it?</h4>
I had a great experience doing Theatre in High School and was really inspired by seeing TR at CAL-laboration! Now that I've been in it for a semester I've decided to stay because being a part of TR has given me an outlet to take creative risks I never imagined myself taking. Being a part of TR means being part of a zany creative family that supports you no matter what.
