</p>
<p><strong>4) Why did you join Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

I joined it so that I could continue my love for performing with such
amazing people.  Also, Theatre Rice is such a good community of friends
that I can't help but be addicted to it.  Everyone is too creative, too
crazy, too fun and thats why I come back.  <img src="smile.png">
</p>
<p><strong>5) What do you do for fun outside of Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

Play tennis, eat ALOT, dance mucho, watch movies that will make me cry or
be inspired, and go on wild adventures with friends.
</p>
<p><strong>6) What makes you unique and flavorful?</strong><br>

I dance my heart out to SHABOOYA and I'm oh-so spunky and weird.
</p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>

Theatre Rice lets me challenge myself in so many ways.  Its a place for me
to break out of my mold and know that I have a support group behind me to
do that.  So I guess you can say Theatre Rice lets me challenge myself,
not only in the cast and for shows, but just as a person.  I guess thats
what I want.
</p>
<p><strong>8) If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?</strong><br>

A pheonix! Its beautiful, mysterious, flies around, and is Dumbledore's
companion.  And it can be resurrected! MUAHAHA.
</p>
<p><strong>9) In the spirit of animals, descibe your ideal mate.</strong><br>

Someone I can fart, burp, poop, and do whatever around.  Someone I can be
so comfortable with and will accept me for me, good and bad.  Sense of
humor, outgoing, and will show me that he cares through his actions, not
just words. He's gotta be a simple kinda guy too.  Fancy things dont mean
nothin in this world. Eating hot cheetos and hot dogs from 7/11 is good
enough (just not all the time).  Oh yea, he just knows how to make me feel
better.
</p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>

To teleport so I can travel the world, save gas, and be with everyone I
love without restrictions.
</p>
<p><strong>11) What other-people traits do you find attractive?</strong><br>

Perseverance, DONT CARE WHAT PEOPLE THINK attitudes,  confidence,
addicting smiles and laughs, and mystery.
</p>
<p><strong>12) What other-people traits drive you crazy?</strong><br>

Arrogance, being fake, close-minded, lives life as a follower.
</p>
<p><strong>13) What would be your first act after successfully taking over the
  world?</strong><br>
  
Make everyone wear no clothes on hot days. ooooo yessss....
</p>
<p><strong>14) If you could go back in time and star in any movie, what role would
  you play?</strong><br>
  
Rose from Titanic. Oh man, a moment with Leonardo Dicaprio in that car is
heaven to me. Delicious.
</p>
<p><strong>15) What is your ultimate purpose in life?</strong><br>

To live it to the fullest.
