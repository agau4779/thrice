<p><strong>1) Name?</strong><br> 

Joy Regullano
</p>
<p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br>

first year... English I think? Maybe a minor in Spanish or Theatre?
</p>
<p><strong>3) Semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

2nd. Yay!
</p>
<p><strong>4) Why did you join Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

I love performing. And I love making people laugh.
</p>
<p><strong>5) What do you do for fun outside of Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

Read poetry. Write (bad) poetry. Write reviews and opinion. Blog. Watch cartoons. Try to get a job.
</p>
<p><strong>6) What makes you unique and flavorful?</strong><br>

I'm a dense little ball of energy... kind of like a star? I can also put my fist in my mouth. See above.

</p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>

It's helping fulfill my performer/actress side... and giving me a bunch of friends.
</p>
<p><strong>8) If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?</strong><br>

A hummingbird, because I'm energetic and I'm always buzzing around on different levels. Try to keep up with me. 
</p>
<p><strong>9) In the spirit of animals, descibe your ideal mate.</strong><br>

Intelligent, romantic, looks kinda like Rivers Cuomo, writes beautiful poetry for me. Or if not poetry, he'd express himself in some sort of art. Great sense of humor. Always knows how to make me stop crying or feel better about myself. Taller than me. He'd be okay with my extreme weirdness and make me a better person. Of course, I'm flexible.
</p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>

To know what people are thinking, and with this knowledge, be able to manipulate them. I would be unstoppable. I could make anyone fall in love with me. I could make world peace. I could... have people make me sandwiches on command.
</p>
<p><strong>11) What other-people traits do you find attractive?</strong><br>

Can make me laugh. Can exchange witty banter with me. Intelligence. Creativity. A winning smile. Being taller than me. (Which is almost everyone.)
</p>
<p><strong>12) What other-people traits drive you crazy?</strong><br>

Knowing that they're good-looking, or well-liked. Selfishness. Close-mindedness. Ignorance.
</p>
<p><strong>13) What would be your first act after successfully taking over the
  world?</strong><br>
  
Getting rid of all armies everywhere.
</p>
<p><strong>14) If you could go back in time and star in any movie, what role would
  you play?</strong><br>
  
Maybe the princess in Enchanted. She said so many things that I believe in. And I think I could pull that innocence off. ;]
</p>
<p><strong>15) What is your ultimate purpose in life?</strong><br>

Well, I guess first it would be to find that ultimate purpose. But I guess overall... making the world better. Whether it's through laughter, or words, or acting.
