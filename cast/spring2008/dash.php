<p><strong>1) Name?</strong><br>
Dash</p>
<p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br>
Junior and English</p>
<p><strong>3) Semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>
This is number two!</p>
<p><strong>4) Why did you join Theatre Rice?</strong><br>
Because Will and Duma sold it very well to me.</p>
<p><strong>5) What do you do for fun outside of Theatre Rice?</strong><br>
I do a lot of reading, a play in a rock and roll band, and I watch odd British shows!</p>
<p><strong>6) What makes you unique and flavorful?</strong><br>
  As a happa-kid, my eyes are a cool color.  I think my personality makes me flavorful.  And I guess that flavor would be... pina colada.  Or... blueberry.</p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>
Theatre Rice will help me fulfill the universal goal of having an awesome time and meeting lifetime friends.  In addition, it'll help rocket me into super stardom!  Although, in case that second one doesn't pan out, the first one is cool.</p>
<p><strong>8) If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?</strong><br>
I would be a falcon.  Because first off, flying would kick so much ass it's not even funny.  Second, of all the birds, falcons are pretty tough.  They don't take shit.  So I would be a falcon because for birds they're pretty bad-ass and they can fly.  Specifically: a Peregrin Falcon.  </p>
<p><strong>9) In the spirit of animals, descibe your ideal mate.</strong><br>
My ideal mate would be loyal.  She'd be a lot like me, but different enough that we could learn from each other, you know, like... flight patterns, gliding style, where could rodents and small cats could be found.  </p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>
It's really gotta be superspeed for me.  I'm the incredible Dash.  </p>
<p><strong>11) What other-people traits do you find attractive?</strong><br>
Sense of humor, a good laugh, patience, low levels of nerdiness.</p>
<p><strong>12) What other-people traits drive you crazy?</strong><br>
A bad laugh, closemindedness, pretentiousness, hate.</p>
<p><strong>13) What would be your first act after successfully taking over the
  world?</strong><br>
I would make arbor day a proper holiday.  With presents and an arbor day tree.  It would be a cactus.  On Arbor Day all the little kids would wake up, open their presents, and paint the arbor day tree.  Then they'd place the tree in the middle of the room, light it on fire, and sing nursery rhymes.</p>
<p><strong>14) If you could go back in time and star in any movie, what role would
  you play?</strong><br>
This is really really hard.  Because I don't think McGann did a great job, I'd go back and star in the Made-for-television movie, Doctor Who: The Enemy Within.  Me up against Eric Roberts.  Yeayuh.</p>
<p><strong>15) What is your ultimate purpose in life?</strong><br>
To do the best that I can at everything I try and help people do the same along the way, all while having an awesome time.</p>
