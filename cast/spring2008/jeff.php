<p><strong>1) Name?</strong><br> 

Jeff Uchida

</p>
<p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br>

I am a Junior Spring Admit and my Major is English... ladies.
</p>
<p><strong>3) Semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

This will be my first semester... ladies.
</p>
<p><strong>4) Why did you join Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

I wanted to try something new and exotic, but after I learned about this club, I dropped my plans for Fiji and settled for Theatre Rice. You don't like that answer? How about this: I joined TR because I am a robot sent back from the future to change the past with my vast knowledge of robot comedies. With the knowledge that I possess, I will change the face of comedy forever by introducing a new form of improv: Improbotics. Improbotics mostly concerns itself with making computer sounds and doing the robot. You'd understand if you were either a robot or from the future. I'm telling you, it'll be a hit in the year 3010.<br>

I just wanted to try something new and meet new people. I figured this was a good place to start.
</p>
<p><strong>5) What do you do for fun outside of Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

Well, I don't do too much. I'll sit in a dark room and think for hours, maybe even for days. But nowadays, I just like to listen to music, play the guitar, stare at youtube videos, play some video games, mess around on MySpace and Facebook.
</p>
<p><strong>6) What makes you unique and flavorful?</strong><br>

I am unique... and flavorful? I've never tasted me before. I bet I taste a lot like Chocolate. I've been eating an unhealthy amount of chocolate goods. I'm mostly unique/certifiable for talking to myself a lot. What can I say? I love the sound of my voice, just not on tape.
</p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>

I hope to break out of my protective bubble and make some friends. To, you know, reach out and touch someone... ladies.
</p>
<p><strong>8) If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?</strong><br>

I'd be an eagle. Eagles are American. I'm American. I am soooo Patriotic. I also happen to think that they are beautiful, magnificent, and graceful creatures.n.
</p>
<p><strong>9) In the spirit of animals, descibe your ideal mate.</strong><br>

If we're in the spirit of animals, I'd hope my ideal mate was another Eagle. No interspecies relationships for me. What? Am I being specieist? If it were a human-human type of relationship, I'd like to meet a girl who had the same dry and sarcastic sense of humor as me. As for animal-human relationships, I'd hope my mate would feed me everyday so I won't starve to death.
</p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>

I'd want to fly. Yeah. I'd like to travel the world without the restrictions of an aircraft. Of course, you'd have to be aware of air regulations created by the FAA as well as other airplanes. Nothing ruins a nice flight like getting sucked into a jet engine or crashing through a cockpit.
</p>
<p><strong>11) What other-people traits do you find attractive?</strong><br>

Funny, witty, talkative, silly, and vice versa.
</p>
<p><strong>12) What other-people traits drive you crazy?</strong><br>

Mean and nasty people, especially people who like Jar-Jar Binks. That's just ridiculous. Also, I hate people who leave you waiting for years with so many questions. I'm looking at you, "Duke Nukem Forever".
</p>
<p><strong>13) What would be your first act after successfully taking over the
  world?</strong><br>
  
Probably pay off all my outstanding fees and find a place closer to campus. After that, I'd probably destroy an island or two, just for the hell of it. I'd, of course, make sure no one was living on the targeted island. If someone were on one of my intended targets, I'd give them a mansion in the Bahamas or something. That should appease my subjects, err, I mean friends.
</p>
<p><strong>14) If you could go back in time and star in any movie, what role would
  you play?</strong><br>
  
That is a very good question. I've never really thought of that. I really liked "The Wedding Singer" but I'm not a fan of the time period. "The Matrix "was pretty cool. I'd want to download information into my brain and learn how to play more songs on the guitar that aren't by KT Tunstall, not that there's anything wrong with her. I'm a huge fan, but I really want to play something that isn't "Black Horse and Cherry Tree" or "Hold On" (as much as I love those songs).
</p>
<p><strong>15) What is your ultimate purpose in life?</strong><br>

To write for TV would be cool. I'm a huge fan of "The Office" and "30 Rock". I'd love to create shows like those. I'm also a huge fan of stand-up comedy. If you couldn't already tell, my favorite comedian is Demetri Martin.
