<p><strong>1) Name?</strong><br> 
Adrienne Sancho
</p>
<p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br>
Graduating Senior, Asian American Studies Major, Education Minor</p>
<p><strong>3) Semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>
This is my first! YAY!</p>
<p><strong>4) Why did you join Theatre Rice?</strong><br>
I've been interested since my freshman year, but I was too busy with other extra-curricular activities.  I finally decided to join because I finished my major and want to learn more about Asian American issues and felt Theatre Rice could do this for me.  Plus, it looks like it would be so much fun!</p>
<p><strong>5) What do you do for fun outside of Theatre Rice?</strong><br>
I play music and watch Cal Football and Basketball.  I put those two together my second year and joined Cal Band.  I also enjoy taking embarrassing pictures of friends, going out and exploring, and trying to stop my addiction to chuck taylors.</p>
<p><strong>6) What makes you unique and flavorful?</strong><br>
I am willing to eat breakfast at all meals everyday, as long as I alternate sweet and savory dishes…  for example, if I had pancakes at dinner one night, I won't order waffles for brunch the next day, but eggs benedict or an omelet.  However, chicken and waffles (or pancakes if I go to Jodie's) are both savory and sweet, so they can be ordered whenever. </p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>
I am hoping to step out of my comfort zone and build more confidence in my abilities with TR's help. </p>
<p><strong>8) If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?</strong><br>
Michelangelo from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because he has fierce nunchuku skills, is always ready when needed, likes to have fun, loves pizza, and is a party dude that "LOVES being a turtle."</p>
<p><strong>9) In the spirit of animals, descibe your ideal mate.</strong><br>
Someone that makes me laugh, can play music, is super passionate about what they love, intelligent, loyal, likes to snuggle... oh and he has to be rich.  Hey, SOMEONE needs to help me pay for law school...</p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>
I think regeneration/immunity like Wolverine and Heroes' Claire Bennett is pretty awesome, I could do all the daredevil things I want to do without getting hurt.  That with the ability of adoptive muscle memory would be amazing!</p>
<p><strong>11) What other-people traits do you find attractive?</strong><br>
Fun, confidence, culture, easy going, and humorous.</p>
<p><strong>12) What other-people traits drive you crazy?</strong><br>
Not thinking before they speak.  The order is brain -> mouth, not mouth-> empty space where your brain should be. Ignorance and pretentiousness are up there.</p>
<p><strong>13) What would be your first act after successfully taking over the
  world?</strong><br>
Find a way to blow up the universe like the King of the Cosmos and making some peon roll up things around earth into a katamari to recreate the planets and stars I destroyed.  Essentially a live version of Katamari Damacy.</p>
<p><strong>14) If you could go back in time and star in any movie, what role would
  you play?</strong><br>
Kill Bill: The Bride/Beatrix Kiddo </p>
<p><strong>15) What is your ultimate purpose in life?</strong><br>
To be happy and overcome any obstacles in my path.</p>
