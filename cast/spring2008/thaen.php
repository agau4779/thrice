<p><strong>1) Name?</strong><br> 
  Thaen Chiam Saefong it’s pronounced Tan-Jem-Say-Fong or just call
me Tangerine. =)
</p>
<p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br>
Junior 09’ woot woot. Sociology BA. but will be going
for a PsyD. Degree.</p>
<p><strong>3) Semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>
Secundo</p>
<p><strong>4) Why did you join Theatre Rice?</strong><br>
Since discovering TR last semester, it
has been a refuge for me to escape to and just have fun and be around
great hilarious people. Joining TR is a great therapeutic experience,
without it I don’t know how I will be sane. In addition, not only is it
therapeutic when I am there, but even when I am not it helps. Because
normally, when I am stress, I waste a lot of my time just worrying about
dumb stuff, when with TR I use that time to be memorizing lines or being
creative. So YAY, for being given his opportunity to share with you guys
again! =)</p>
<p><strong>5) What do you do for fun outside of Theatre Rice?</strong><br>
This is fun, but also
part of my job. Outside of school and TR I am a rehab clinic counselor,
which means I attempt to help people addicted to drugs maintain a recovery
lifestyle. That means I get to see people change a little bit each day and
each week. It’s sort of like watching a fast forwarding clip of a
blossoming flower or changing of the seasons-- quite amazing. As for
recreation, I like to go bowling @ Albany bowl, lots of laughs, cheers,
booing and high-fives!!</p>
<p><strong>6) What makes you unique and flavorful?</strong><br>
I guess I will break this question
up. For uniqueness, I guess I would say that I am a very honest person who
isn’t afraid to state what is real about myself and others. I tend to be
very positive and always seek for alternatives even when there seems to be
no way, I’m quite stubborn in that way.<br>
As far as being flavorful—someone told me that I was like an onion because
I had many layers and I made her cry, and I guess onions brings a lot of
flavor to a dish. If you eat it raw, it has this stingy sweetness to it.
That’s my uniqueness and flavorfulness, I a real and raw, full of stingy
sweetness.</p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>
A personal goal of
mine was to find time in my busy schedule for myself. Since I’m already
working two jobs and am a fulltime student I was always preoccupy with
everything else I had to do in life, pay the bills, rent, get a degree,
etc. Then I found TR. I can honestly say that my personal goal has been
fulfilled; TR is my time for me to enjoy myself. Theatre-wise, TR has a
wide range of opportunities for me to get over my fear of performing and
my ultimate fear...IMPROV. Yikes!!!</p>
<p><strong>8) If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?</strong><br>
A Sea horse,
because they are the only species where the male becomes pregnant. The
female is the one who “deposits” her eggs into his pouch and he carries
them for the duration of the pregnancy. SWEET!</p>
<p><strong>9) In the spirit of animals, descibe your ideal mate.</strong><br>
I don’t know what
spirits or animals have to do with ideal mate???? So I’ll just go with
Tarzan.</p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>
I would
want the ability to HEAL both physiological and mental illness. I hate
when people are in pain.</p>
<p><strong>11) What other-people traits do you find attractive?</strong><br>
Physically??? Well on
guys, strong arms, the better to hold me with. =) On girls, the eyes,
because they are very seductive. In general a good smile, because you
never know who will fall in love with it. Misc: A good listener, hugger
and kisser, a person with a fast metabolism because they can keep me warm
during the winter.</p>
<p><strong>12) What other-people traits drive you crazy?</strong><br>
A unibrow; I’ve never meet
any one who made a unibrow attractive and it drives me crazy because they
just don’t shave off the middle. Smacking of the mouth when chewing gum.
Shaking of the leg and un-attentiveness. Oh and tallness. People who are
freakishly tall drives me crazy, mainly due to envy, but also because they
walk and run weird, like Yao Ming and Andres Beindrins.</p>
<p><strong>13) What would be your first act after successfully taking over the
  world?</strong><br>
I would demolish all the casinos, because gambling is a great evil.</p>
<p><strong>14) If you could go back in time and star in any movie, what role would
  you play?</strong><br>
I would want to play Matilda in Matilda.</p>
<p><strong>15) What is your ultimate purpose in life?</strong><br>
To united the Iu Mien Community.</p>
