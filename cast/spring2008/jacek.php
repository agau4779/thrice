<p><strong>1) Name?</strong><br> 

Jacek Wnuk

</p>
<p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br>

Second year EECS major!
</p>
<p><strong>3) Semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

This'll be my second semester.
</p>
<p><strong>4) Why did you join Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

Being adventurous, I decided to try it after hearing about it from Anthony Wee, Yue Tu, and Elita Wong.  In the end, I got addicted to the adrenaline rush of making an ass out of myself onstage in front of hundreds of people.  It's fantastic!
</p>
<p><strong>5) What do you do for fun outside of Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

I'm rather adventurous and always willing to try new things, so I derive a lot of joy from mastery or discovery of something new.  I love to ski, I love to swim, I love to play ukulele, and I love to meet new people and have a great time doing it!
</p>
<p><strong>6) What makes you unique and flavorful?</strong><br>

It must be the hot sauce and the piercing green laser eyes.
</p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>

Theatre Rice gives me an outlet for the crazy amount of energy I keep inside so that I can expose a larger audience to it, and so I can keep it in check for when I really need to buckle down and get to work.  That, and it has allowed me get to know some really amazing people, and that can never be a bad thing.
</p>
<p><strong>8) If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?</strong><br>

Obviously, a King-Kong-esque giant ape.  You know, to get back to humanity's humble roots.  And to eat helicopters that shoot at me.  That'd be a good movie, actually.  JaceKong dominates Earth.  It would also feature exploding barrels, ninjas riding dinosaurs, and gorgeous women.
</p>
<p><strong>9) In the spirit of animals, descibe your ideal mate.</strong><br>

I'm very picky.  It's a must that she be adventurous, intelligent, caring, funny, confident, and beautiful.  Auditions given on a case-by-case basis.
</p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>

Telekinesis!  I've always wanted to be able to move things with my mind.  It just looks so impressive in movies.  Plus, I could pull people from burning buildings and stuff, or pull weapons right out of potential attackers' hands (where heroes are, attackers are bound to appear...  I think it's one of Newton's Laws).  And I could make myself hover over water, or just part the seas like they did in the olden days.
</p>
<p><strong>11) What other-people traits do you find attractive?</strong><br>

A sense of adventure, a sense of humor, and assorted other senses.
</p>
<p><strong>12) What other-people traits drive you crazy?</strong><br>

Cigarettes.  Instant turn-off if there ever was one.
</p>
<p><strong>13) What would be your first act after successfully taking over the
  world?</strong><br>
  
Use all the remaining nuclear missiles worldwide to improve humanity's space-travel capabilities and establish colonies on other planets.
</p>
<p><strong>14) If you could go back in time and star in any movie, what role would
  you play?</strong><br>
  
Marty McFly in Back to the Future.  Those movies are classics!  Especially the first and third, not so much the second.
</p>
<p><strong>15) What is your ultimate purpose in life?</strong><br>

To remain mysterious regarding my ultimate purpose in life.
