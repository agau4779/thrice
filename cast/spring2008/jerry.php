Jerry Lee
</p>
<p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br>
First Year, Second Semester, No idea what I want to do with the rest of my life.</p>
<p><strong>3) Semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>
Starting my second semester in Rice!</p>
<p><strong>4) Why did you join Theatre Rice?</strong><br>
The first time was because I thought we were going to eat rice-related snacks and watch movies. I had to the second time because I got a committee position and it wouldn't make sense if I didn't join. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.</p>
<p><strong>5) What do you do for fun outside of Theatre Rice?</strong><br>
"Fun" can be found outside of Theatre Rice? Son of a monkey.</p>
<p><strong>6) What makes you unique and flavorful?</strong><br>
Why don't you try a bite and see for yourself?</p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>
I'll tell you once I figure out what my goals are.</p>
<p><strong>8) If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?</strong><br>
A Turtle. The teenage mutant ninja variety. I want to be able to beat the shell out of anyone and sneak away undetected.</p>
<p><strong>9) In the spirit of animals, descibe your ideal mate.</strong><br>
Uh...I don't get this question. A sea otter?</p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>
Manipulating time. I've always wanted to freeze time and take a bite out of someone's sandwich right before that person does and laugh at the what-the-hell-just-happened expression on his or her face.
And I could go back in time and stop myself from doing stupid things.</p>
<p><strong>11) What other-people traits do you find attractive?</strong><br>
The eyes.</p>
<p><strong>12) What other-people traits drive you crazy?</strong><br>
People who make me wait, people who don't know when to be what, and people who hate others without trying to get to know them first.</p>
<p><strong>13) What would be your first act after successfully taking over the
  world?</strong><br>
Either force everyone to play children's card games or force an end to the writer's strike so I can watch my shows again.</p>
<p><strong>14) If you could go back in time and star in any movie, what role would
  you play?</strong><br>
Bruce Lee's character Tang Lung in Way of the Dragon. I've always wanted to kick Chuck Norris' ass.</p>
<p><strong>15) What is your ultimate purpose in life?</strong><br>
To bring laughter to those who need it. Then to those who want it. Then those who are ambivalent towards it. And then finally to those who say they don't want it but secretly do.</p>
