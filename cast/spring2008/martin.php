</p>
<p><strong>4) Why did you join Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

 Being a community college student I don’t talk to many people at school, and I wanted to be in an environment where I could be myself and where people will accept me for who I am. AND BECAUSE THEATRE RICE ROCKS!
</p>

Eat. Sleep. Some photography. Sleep. Drive around. Watch movies. Hat shopping. Traveling.

<p><strong>6) What makes you unique and flavorful?</strong><br>

</p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>

To be more open with others, to not be shy around people, to be more happy and less depressed about school.
</p>
<p><strong>8) If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?</strong><br>

I’d probably be a panda because, of course, I am too cute. Also because all pandas do all day is sleep and eat, which is basically what I do when I get back to my apartment.
</p>
<p><strong>9) In the spirit of animals, descibe your ideal mate.</strong><br>

Smart. Funny. Pretty. A girl who will love me for who I truly am and a girl who would make a great mother. Also someone who would will get along with and love my family and friends just as much as I do.
</p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>

Kind, considerate, thoughtful, and trustworthy.

Self-centered, arrogant, snobby, cocky, and selfish.
</p>
<p><strong>13) What would be your first act after successfully taking over the
  world?</strong><br>
  
I will know when that happens, I will know.
</p>
<p><strong>14) If you could go back in time and star in any movie, what role would
  you play?</strong><br>
  
Lets see if I were to go back into time, I’d probably take the place of Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone, and then I’d probably cut the movie in half by just calling the police in the first place instead of wasting a whole week preparing for someone who was planning to break into my house and possibly kill me. No scratch that, if I knew someone was going to break into my house ahead of time, I would probably call the police even before they got to my house, psh, that movie was such a waste of time and money.
</p>
<p><strong>15) What is your ultimate purpose in life?</strong><br>

To be successful, to be happy, to carryout long life friendships, and to give my parents grandchildren and my wife cute and smart kids. If my kids aren’t cute and smart… well we will just worry about that when it comes up.
