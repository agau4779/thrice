<p><strong>3) Semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

This is my first.  <img src="smile.png">
</p>
<p><strong>4) Why did you join Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

I missed the craziness of times like tech week and the truly amazing
people you meet through theater.
</p>
<p><strong>5) What do you do for fun outside of Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

Take naps in random places, worship the color orange, eat caramel
(pronounced cahr-mel), go outside, and watch Rebelde.
</p>
<p><strong>6) What makes you unique and flavorful?</strong><br>

My sock collection; socks are amazing and wonderful things, you can find a
pair to suit any mood or emotion and then you don't have to wear your
heart on your sleeve, because its already safely tucked away in your shoe
waiting to be revealed only at the opportune moment.
</p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>

Make me happier and generally more pleasant to be around.
</p>
<p><strong>8) If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?</strong><br>

Most definitely a golden lion tamarin/ golden marmoset; small, fluffy, and
Brazilian with one of the most astounding heads of hair on earth.
</p>
<p><strong>9) In the spirit of animals, descibe your ideal mate.</strong><br>

A fossa; sly, agile, and self-contained from a distance, yet fuzzy and
cat-like up close; self-possessed and capable but still with a bit of
flair.
</p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>

Since I think Jina already took omni-linguism, the ability to remember
where my key is.
</p>
<p><strong>11) What other-people traits do you find attractive?</strong><br>

Confidence, perseverance, a willingness to try anything, adventurousness,
optimism, curiosity, passion, a sense of humor, and a love of life.
</p>
<p><strong>12) What other-people traits drive you crazy?</strong><br>

When people crack their knuckles.  A lack of willingness to try new
things.  Hatefulness, spite, fear, bitterness, prejudice, and pessimism. 
When someone constantly feels the need to rain on my parade.
</p>
<p><strong>13) What would be your first act after successfully taking over the
  world?</strong><br>
  
Do a happy dance.
</p>
<p><strong>14) If you could go back in time and star in any movie, what role would
  you play?</strong><br>
  
Debbie Reynold's character Kathy Selden in "Singin' in the Rain", and if
that isn't open, Cruella de Vil in "101 Dalmations".
</p>
<p><strong>15) What is your ultimate purpose in life?</strong><br>

To fight for all that is good and just/ be happy and make the world a
friendlier place to live in.
