<p><strong>1) Name?</strong><br> 

Melvyn Manapsal
</p>
<p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br>

4th year and GRADUATING! woot! with degrees in Film Studies and Mass
Communications!
</p>
<p><strong>3) Semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

3 (or 4 if you include summer <img src="smile.png">)
</p>
<p><strong>4) Why did you join Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

Before TR, I invested my time and emotions in TV shows. Now, I'm invested
in both.
</p>
<p><strong>5) What do you do for fun outside of Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

I think I just answered this question...<br>
Well, I also like to cook, sleep, watch movies, and read fiction novels
like The DaVinci Code, Angels and Demons, Harry Potter, and the series
starting with The Golden Compass
</p>
<p><strong>6) What makes you unique and flavorful?</strong><br>

My orange-ish brown-tipped hair. It's fiery.
</p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>

TR really gave me the opportunity to break out of my comfort zone, meet
all kinds of different people, become a leader, and learn A LOT about
myself. These are all things that will assist me when I step out into the
frightening place of the real world outside of college life. I'm proud to
say that TR is really one of the most valuable experiences of my life, and
in a time too soon from now, I'll miss it dearly.

<p><strong>8) If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?</strong><br>

I'd be a feak: Falcon, EAgle, hawK combined
</p>
<p><strong>9) In the spirit of animals, descibe your ideal mate.</strong><br>

Impressive plumage and a beautiful bird song
</p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>

To fly, because I could go anywhere in the world at my own convenience -
places like New Zealand, Alaska, Greece, and Madagascar. And for some
reason I love that thrilling feeling of your stomach dropping suddenly
when you drop (like on a roller coaster)
</p>
<p><strong>11) What other-people traits do you find attractive?</strong><br>

Goals, drive, confidence, and punctuality are attractive qualities to me.
As for attractive male body parts, I like defined abs and back muscles,
and sometimes even leg muscles like Brad Pitt in Troy. But I don't
discriminate: legs and junk in the trunk are what I check out in girls.
</p>
<p><strong>12) What other-people traits drive you crazy?</strong><br>

Long phone conversations that happen in the middle of something so that I
am just left listening and waiting for them to get off the phone.
</p>
<p><strong>13) What would be your first act after successfully taking over the
  world?</strong><br>
  
Eat some gyoza
</p>
<p><strong>14) If you could go back in time and star in any movie, what role would
  you play?</strong><br>
  
I would play Ingrid Bergman's character Ilsa Lund in Casablanca because
the movie is such a classic now
</p>
<p><strong>15) What is your ultimate purpose in life?</strong><br>

I have three: Be happy, Be me, and Save the environment.
