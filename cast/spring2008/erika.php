<p><strong>1) Name?</strong><br> 

Erika "Erkahhh" Pallasigue

</p>
<p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br>

1st year, intended minor in theatre, major currently undecided
</p>
<p><strong>3) Semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

This is my first semester.
</p>
<p><strong>4) Why did you join Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

Someone shoved a flier in my face as I was walking peacefully through
Sproul. Ok, there was more to it than that. I joined TR because I needed a
place to be able to express myself and get my creative juices flowing. I
also wanted to find a group of people who can take me as I am and be a
loving family to me.
</p>
<p><strong>5) What do you do for fun outside of Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

I eat, I breathe, I talk to myself, I write, I dance around in my
underwear when my roommate's not home. I like to watch movies, lots of
movies, especially the old black and white classics (with Vivien Leigh
and Clark Gable), I like to write letters to people and lick the stamp
and then send it off hoping that the receiver will smile when they open
the letter that I had lovingly written just for them. Most of all, for
fun, I like to be with people who encourage me to live life in the most
creative, unique and exciting way possible.


</p>
<p><strong>6) What makes you unique and flavorful?</strong><br>

The way I talk, how I say things, how I move, how I eat, how I
breathe...basically, everything I do makes me unique cause no one does
things the way I do.
<br>
Flavorful? Hmm...there are a few things that I do that contribute to my
SPICYNESS, but I'll leave that to the imagination. <img src="smile.png">
</p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>

Theatre Rice will be the stepping stone for a lot of goals in my life.
From this organization, I hope to gain confidence in myself, I want to be
able to keep and open mind and an open heart at all times, I would like to
be as accepting of others as they are of me, and most of all, I desire to
have the ability, at all times, to FUCK MY FEAR!
</p>
<p><strong>8) If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?</strong><br>

I would be a yellow duck because they float around and are fed by people
who watch them and say, "Aww, how cute!"
</p>
<p><strong>9) In the spirit of animals, descibe your ideal mate.</strong><br>

My ideal mate is a person who will always respect me as I respect them and
who will accept me as I am and love me for my flaws and see beauty in all
that I do.
</p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>

I would be able to read minds, but only when the thoughts pertain to me
because I don't want to know everyone's business, just the business
that concerns me.

</p>
<p><strong>11) What other-people traits do you find attractive?</strong><br>

Crooked smiles attract me. The way people smell is attractive. I like
voices and how very different someone's voice can be from all others. It's
the uniqueness of each person that attracts me to them.
</p>
<p><strong>12) What other-people traits drive you crazy?</strong><br>

The way people eat bananas and make that squishy noise. Oh, and when
people use "hella" between every other word.
</p>
<p><strong>13) What would be your first act after successfully taking over the
  world?</strong><br>
  
I would create a duck sanctuary. Well, no, first I'd have the Belgians
make me really good Belgian chocolate, then I'd create that duck
sanctuary. And somewhere along there I'd stop the war...
</p>
<p><strong>14) If you could go back in time and star in any movie, what role would
  you play?</strong><br>
  
I would play Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind because I'd get to kiss
Clark Gable and play the most interesting character ever produced by pen
and paper.
</p>
<p><strong>15) What is your ultimate purpose in life?</strong><br>

To live with grace, respect for others, complete love, and gratitude. Oh,
and to produce creative masterpieces that will render me immortal.
</p>
