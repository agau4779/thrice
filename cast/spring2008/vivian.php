<p><strong>1) Name?</strong><br> 

Vivian Huang
</p>
<p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br>

Fourth year double major in English and Theater & Performance Studies
</p>
<p><strong>3) Semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

Going on five
</p>
<p><strong>4) Why did you join Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

I joined my first semester because I was hungry if not greedy for anything theatre, but I continue coming back because socially conscious representation in the performing arts is a big interest of mine, and the energy of this group is unlike any other.
</p>
<p><strong>5) What do you do for fun outside of Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

I like to sleep, talk with my loved ones, eat gluttonous goodies like Cheese Board pizza with Ed, watch Project Runway, journal, write letters, buy and make greeting cards, attempt to make delicious foods and go see shows!
</p>
<p><strong>6) What makes you unique and flavorful?</strong><br>

I'm really interested in the performance of the racialized body, which is what I should be thinking about in regards to my thesis when I'm not doing any of the things mentioned in Question #5. But really, I'm into live performance for the long haul... there's something so amazing about the whole concept and ongoing history of performance, isn't there?
</p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>

In many ways: from building up my confidence to take risks like improv-ing and talking to people, to further contributing to the conversation of what it is to be an Asian American performing artist.
</p>
<p><strong>8) If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?</strong><br>

I'll say a bunny, because I love their big thumper feet!  Also, if you Google "gigantic bunny" and click on Images, you'll see some ridiculously big - and adorable - rabbits! Oh, and I love pigs :@) and I really want a Corgi!!
</p>
<p><strong>9) In the spirit of animals, descibe your ideal mate.</strong><br>

Someone honest and loving who has the perspective and sense of humor to want to put up with me.
</p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>

Having superpowers could get super scary, so I'm not sure.  Well, I think it'd be pretty sweet and useful to be able to quell fear in people. I think being able to go back and forth in time could be cool, but also really overwhelming.
</p>
<p><strong>11) What other-people traits do you find attractive?</strong><br>

A good balance of confidence and humility, strong relationships with loved ones, fair treatment to all, patience, intelligence, bravery, resilience, hope, perspective, and a super sense of humor,...
</p>
<p><strong>12) What other-people traits drive you crazy?</strong><br>

Excessive self-importance, unwillingness to laugh, taking things for granted, smoking cigarettes, lazy ignorance,...
</p>
<p><strong>13) What would be your first act after successfully taking over the
  world?</strong><br>
  
Watching pigs fly and asking my unicorn friend how the heck I was able to take over the world. My second act might be to destroy all firearms and laws enabling their usage.
</p>
<p><strong>14) If you could go back in time and star in any movie, what role would
  you play?</strong><br>
  
Probably Amelie, or Celine in Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. 
</p>
<p><strong>15) What is your ultimate purpose in life?</strong><br>

To do justice to all the opportunities with which my family has provided me by giving my best to my loved ones, laughing (in a good way) every day, and making things better somehow, somewhere in the world.
