Unique (or weird): I enjoy riding subways during rush hour.<br>
Flavorful: with Rice, of course. And maybe some nutmeg.</p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>
It gives me hope that the following questions may come true. And I get to
express myself. Two for one, man!</p>

It wouldn't make sense... kangaroos can't wear leather!</p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>
