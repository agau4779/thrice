<p><strong>1) Name?</strong><br> 

Gene Lu Wang (though the "Lu" is unofficial - I took it on after my maternal grandfather passed away a few years back)

</p>
<p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br>

Fourth year, in English & Mass Communications
</p>
<p><strong>3) Semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

First one.
</p>
<p><strong>4) Why did you join Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

I took a break from Berkeley & studied abroad in London for about 6 months last spring; living in that atmosphere really opened me up to a whole new world of stage performance & live theater, whereas before I had been mostly interested in TV, music videos and film.
</p>
<p><strong>5) What do you do for fun outside of Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

I sit on the roofdeck of my awesome northside apartment in the hills (to which everyone is invited at all times by the way....exercise is good) and watch a different sunset every day. It's just amazing. I also can't stop taking pictures; I have my camera on me at all times. My "introspective" side likes to write poetry and do homework. My "wild" side likes to go clubbing and aspires to be a male go-go dancer ;)
</p>
<p><strong>6) What makes you unique and flavorful?</strong><br>

Sometimes I think I'm meant to be a shaman or a spiritual guide of some sort. But then I get sidetracked (see above). No, seriously though, I have these insane moments of clarity and natural highs, thanks to my meditation instructors, which I'd love to develop further in the future. I don't know if that makes me "unique," but I think talking to trees, making psychic journeys, and balancing chakras can be seen as slightly "flavorful"? =P
</p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>

It exposes me to a lot of people who are already comfortable with expressing themselves bravely and fully and courageously, and also others like me, who are, at least, interested in doing so, and I think that that just creates a powerful environment in which to grow, share, teach, learn from each other, and become inspired about life in general.
</p>
<p><strong>8) If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?</strong><br>

I relate an incredible degree to my zodiac animal, the tiger. Tigers are beautiful but deadly. Wait, no, that's not the reason I relate. But they are, aren't they? =]
</p>
<p><strong>9) In the spirit of animals, descibe your ideal mate.</strong><br>

Passionate, loyal, giving, knowing when to give but also when to take, solid, courageous, responsible, experimental, someone who brings out the best in me but doesn't want to keep it all selfishly but wants me to share that part of myself with the world as well. Someone who understands the nature, and importance of gratitude.
</p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>

Telekenesis and/or producing & manipulating fire. Setting people (and things) on fire.
</p>
<p><strong>11) What other-people traits do you find attractive?</strong><br>

Patience. Confidence. Humility. Ability to inspire in others the same, and then inspire those others to want to inspire others, and so on. Spirituality (though this term might be a bit loaded, or misleading...so ask me if you want more clarity). Maturity, but with a live and kicking inner child. And finally, being very in tune with one's own body and its natural, subconscious sensibility/sensuality/sexuality.
</p>
<p><strong>12) What other-people traits drive you crazy?</strong><br>

Rudeness, disregard for others. Not having a sense of boundaries, or of propriety. Impoliteness. Overconfidence, over-ambition, insincerity, inconsiderateness, and the refusal to take responsibility for one's own actions, beliefs, and choices.
</p>
<p><strong>13) What would be your first act after successfully taking over the
  world?</strong><br>
  
Make everyone stop hating/following/snapping-pictures-of/hurting Britney Spears!! And then apply that to the rest of humanity, of course. ;)
</p>
<p><strong>14) If you could go back in time and star in any movie, what role would
  you play?</strong><br>
  

BAAAACCK TO THE FUTUREEEEEEEEEE! The kid. Or I guess the old man, depending on how crazy I'm feeling. Either that or the Karate Kid!
</p>
<p><strong>15) What is your ultimate purpose in life?</strong><br>

You know...I'm not entirely sure yet, but...all I know right now is it has something to do with love, and the people around you. Let me get back to you on this one.
