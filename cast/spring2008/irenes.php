<p><strong>3) Semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

2nd semester now
</p>
<p><strong>4) Why did you join Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

I thought we were getting free rice. We still haven't.<br>

...Any time now.
</p>
<p><strong>5) What do you do for fun outside of Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

Write, sing, play piano, blast music, chat with friends, drink...water
</p>
<p><strong>6) What makes you unique and flavorful?</strong><br>

Alcohol.
</p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>

It's already given me a place to safely step out of my comfort zone and to
be the "me of me." It has made me feel like a contributor (and
participant) in the world of art and creation.
</p>
<p><strong>8) If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?</strong><br>

A baby bird venturing out of his/her nest. Profoundly speaking, I think
baby birds are KYOOTE.
</p>
<p><strong>9) In the spirit of animals, descibe your ideal mate.</strong><br>

Huh? Um, probably someone with the integrity of an iguana, the tenderness
of a pterodactyl, and the maturity of a...mule.
</p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>

At this specific moment in time, the power to organize well would be nice.
But since The Organizer doesn't really sell comic books, maybe the power
to steal other people's powers (Rogue, X-Men).
</p>
<p><strong>11) What other-people traits do you find attractive?</strong><br>

Kindness (which includes
integrity/sincerity/humility/generosity/consideration), unpretentious
profundity/wisdom, a sense of ease about life, and the capacity to give
care. I also think shyness can be very alluring.
</p>
<p><strong>12) What other-people traits drive you crazy?</strong><br>

Overt self-consciousness, self-absorption, crude machoism, immaturity,
arrogance, ignorance, elitism, exclusivity, and the inability to
appreciate.
</p>
<p><strong>13) What would be your first act after successfully taking over the
  world?</strong><br>
  
Take a nap.<br>

...and then overthrow capitalism.
</p>
<p><strong>14) If you could go back in time and star in any movie, what role would
  you play?</strong><br>
  
The Queen in "The Queen." I couldn't do it justice, but damn, I've always
wanted to wear a powdered wig AND a potato sack. Simultaneously. Thaht's
oull.
</p>
<p><strong>15) What is your ultimate purpose in life?</strong><br>

To observe with perspective, to create with integrity, and to give with
abandon.
