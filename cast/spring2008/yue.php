This will be my fourth (crazy I know). 
</p>
<p><strong>4) Why did you join Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

Anthony Wee (EECS '08) suggested that it would be fun for me. Plus, I enjoy my fellow ricers and the message we deliver to the community.
</p>
<p><strong>5) What do you do for fun outside of Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

Oh man too many to list. I enjoy watching movies, listening to music, and hanging out with friends. Just laughing about life and its tests. I'm also an information sponge. I used to watch a lotta professional sports.
</p>
<p><strong>6) What makes you unique and flavorful?</strong><br>

My wide range of interests, hobbies, and my family background. I was born in Tianjin, China. I came to the US at age 6 while my dad came here to obtain a graduate degree. I wrote a whole paper on my family's immigration history for History 137ac, let me know if you want to read it.
</p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>

Theatre Rice gives me sometime to use a different part of my brain, it uses more of the intuition and spontaneity which is a great balance from my project-oriented lifestyle. I want to learn about people. Theatre Rice has given me the opportunity to learn about people, this is very important to me.

<p><strong>8) If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?</strong><br>

I'd be a chimpanzee. Chimps are cool. Chimps are smart. Chimps should get the right to vote (I still don't).
</p>
<p><strong>9) In the spirit of animals, descibe your ideal mate.</strong><br>

Spirit of animals eh? Child rearing hips, dominant alpha-female types. My offspring would have the best chance for survival.
</p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>

Time-travel is a no brainer. How powerful would I be if I could go back into time to experience things and re-experience it by changing something from the past? Out of this world man.
</p>
<p><strong>11) What other-people traits do you find attractive?</strong><br>

Kindness, comedic, loyalty, and maturity. This is not a benchmark, I find a lot of traits admirable or attractive.
</p>
<p><strong>12) What other-people traits drive you crazy?</strong><br>

Taking initiative drives me krazy, in a good way ;)

Drink a beer and enjoy the sunset with the people that helped me take over the world.
</p>
<p><strong>14) If you could go back in time and star in any movie, what role would
  you play?</strong><br>
  
I have two.<br>
George Bailey from It's A Wonderful Life because he's character that I admire.
or Truman Burbank from The Truman Show because I'd love to try pulling off that character.
</p>
<p><strong>15) What is your ultimate purpose in life?</strong><br>

Pursuit of happiness and inspire a future generation of leaders. To be remembered.
