<p><strong>1) Name?</strong><br> 

Eric Hsiao

</p>
<p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br>

Third year, Mass Communications and Sociology
</p>
<p><strong>3) Semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

This is my second.
</p>
<p><strong>4) Why did you join Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

TR has a great reputation on campus, and I really wanted to do something I've never done before.
</p>
<p><strong>5) What do you do for fun outside of Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

Eat too much, sleep too much, watch too many movies, watch too many television shows, watch too much sports, surf too many websites.
</p>
<p><strong>6) What makes you unique and flavorful?</strong><br>

Not much. I'm as boring, stale, and drab as they come.
</p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>

Hopefully, not to be so boring, stale, and drab. And to help me become an international Hollywood superstar who pulls in $20 million per picture.
</p>
<p><strong>8) If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?</strong><br>

Probably a gorilla. I'd maintain some (if not all) of my intelligence and cognizance. And I wouldn't have to be afraid of other animals trying to eat me.
</p>
<p><strong>9) In the spirit of animals, descibe your ideal mate.</strong><br>

In the spirit of animals? I guess someone who wouldn't eat me. You know, praying mantis-wise. And someone who would loyally pick ticks out of my fur.
</p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>

Great intelligence and an incredible memory. Not so weird that I'd be ostracized from society and not too amazing that I'd be exploited by the government. And it would help me in my classes.
</p>
<p><strong>11) What other-people traits do you find attractive?</strong><br>

Perfection.
</p>
<p><strong>12) What other-people traits drive you crazy?</strong><br>

Imperfection.
</p>
<p><strong>13) What would be your first act after successfully taking over the
  world?</strong><br>
  
Execute everyone who enjoyed <em>Donnie Darko</em>, <em>The Birds</em>, <em>The African Queen</em>, <em>Lost in Translation</em>, and <em>Date Movie</em>. 
</p>
<p><strong>14) If you could go back in time and star in any movie, what role would
  you play?</strong><br>
  
Probably Luke Skywalker in <em>Star Wars</em>. It's such an easy, straightforward role, but I'd be immortalized forever on celluloid and in world culture. And it would bring some much-needed Asian flavor to the trilogy.
</p>
<p><strong>15) What is your ultimate purpose in life?</strong><br>

Not to fuck up too badly.
</p>
