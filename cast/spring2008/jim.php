<p><strong>1) Name?</strong><br> 

JimtheChin
</p>
<p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br>

2nd Year History
</p>
<p><strong>3) Semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

Third time’s the charm.
</p>
<p><strong>4) Why did you join Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

Because it was magical!
</p>
<p><strong>5) What do you do for fun outside of Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

Warhammer 40k and other delightfully nerd things. I’ve recently begun learning Taekwondo, which too is wonderful. I also like to dance around in my underwear, as long as no one is watching.
</p>
<p><strong>6) What makes you unique and flavorful?</strong><br>

   I am hairy, and have broken more razors upon my stubble than I can care to count. Or pay for, for that matter. My obsession with The Lord of the Rings borders upon the unhealthy. 
</p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>

   I’m still working on that.
</p>
<p><strong>8) If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?</strong><br>

Godzilla. Arguably one of the coolest animals ever to have walked the imagination.
</p>
<p><strong>9) In the spirit of animals, descibe your ideal mate.</strong><br>

I don’t think there are any Mrs. Godzillas, so that’s a rather depressing worldview!
</p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>

I’m a sucker for well written martial arts noir. Hence, I would have to choose The Immortal Iron Fists’ various powers of awesome. 
</p>
<p><strong>11) What other-people traits do you find attractive?</strong><br>

Spontaneity, creativity, kindness, magnanimity. Delving really deep into relationship questions, aren’t we?
</p>
<p><strong>12) What other-people traits drive you crazy?</strong><br>

Whining, invading other people’s personal spaces, attention-hogging, showing off.
</p>
<p><strong>13) What would be your first act after successfully taking over the
  world?</strong><br>
  
I’d probably take a shower. Or nap. World domination, after all, is a tiring affair!
</p>
<p><strong>14) If you could go back in time and star in any movie, what role would
  you play?</strong><br>
  
This isn’t really going back in time, but I would love to be Beorn if J.R.R. Tolkein’s The Hobbit was being adapted for the screen. 
</p>
<p><strong>15) What is your ultimate purpose in life?</strong><br>

TBD
