Allen "Number 2" Chang
</p>
<p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br>

Senior, Mechanical Engineering
</p>
<p><strong>3) Semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

5th and last... unless i don't get into psych 150...
</p>
<p><strong>4) Why did you join Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

Julius and I's moms know each other, and he gave me a ride home during winter break of my sophomore year. He brought up TR, and it all started from there.
</p>
<p><strong>5) What do you do for fun outside of Theatre Rice?</strong><br>

I like to go to the RSF and feel bad around the big people around me. I also like to run (on occasion), and watch downloaded movies/series.
</p>
<p><strong>6) What makes you unique and flavorful?</strong><br>

Unique and flavorful? I've folded hundreds of cranes in my lifetime, probably thousands. My ears turn red individually, and I'd like to think I'm compassionate by nature. Flavorful? HELL WITH THIS I DON'T WANT ANYONE EATING ME F-YOU
</p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>

It has already helped me to shape my outlook on life and be more positive and courageous. Aside from that, I get a kick at doing new and exciting TR show content.
</p>
<p><strong>8) If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?</strong><br>

I actually took this picture before filling out my questions, and in the picture I was a gopher. But in actuality I'd be a horse; horses seem very majestic and dignified.
</p>
<p><strong>9) In the spirit of animals, descibe your ideal mate.</strong><br>

Aside from physical attraction, someone who opens up to me and is kind, yet bold and can stand up for herself; a thinker also. 
</p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>

This question I think should be switched with question 11, but I think telekinesis. Imagine what marvels in the fields of science could unravel with that ability
</p>
<p><strong>11) What other-people traits do you find attractive?</strong><br>

People who are respectful and deserve respect. Dignified yet humble. 
</p>
<p><strong>12) What other-people traits drive you crazy?</strong><br>

People who deal in absolutes, who can't change their minds and are incapable of sympathy or thinking outside the box. But mostly hateful people.
</p>
<p><strong>13) What would be your first act after successfully taking over the
  world?</strong><br>
  
Disarm all WMDs; they exist in our country only because others have them; not terribly comforting. And get a summer home in Hawaii...
</p>
<p><strong>14) If you could go back in time and star in any movie, what role would
  you play?</strong><br>
  
Terminator, the second one. Or Wong Fei Hong
</p>
<p><strong>15) What is your ultimate purpose in life?</strong><br>

Find conviction and passion in something, and commit to it with heart.
