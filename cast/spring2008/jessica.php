  Jessica Chan
</p>
<p><strong>2) Year and Major?</strong><br>
Sophomore<br>
Film Studies</p>
<p><strong>3) Semesters in Theatre Rice?</strong><br>
2nd</p>
<p><strong>4) Why did you join Theatre Rice?</strong><br>
I saw "STFU" last year and thought, "I want to be one of the cool people
up there."</p>
<p><strong>5) What do you do for fun outside of Theatre Rice?</strong><br>
I like to sleep in on days that I can, watch movies, and giggle.</p>
<p><strong>6) What makes you unique and flavorful?</strong><br>
My giggles...?</p>
<p><strong>7) How will Theatre Rice help you fulfill your goals?</strong><br>
It will help me be a little more outgoing, outspoken, and a little braver.</p>
<p><strong>8) If you could be any animal, what would you be and why?</strong><br>
I guess I would be a cute sexy cat because Jessica Yang always called me
"Sexy Cat Jessica."</p>
<p><strong>9) In the spirit of animals, descibe your ideal mate.</strong><br>
I guess I would want a tiger? Cat...tiger...makes sense right? I guess some
qualities I would like in my "tiger" can be that he'll be there for me, he
won't hold me back, and he has something to say to me.</p>
<p><strong>10) If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?</strong><br>
Umm...after watching a recent Wong Fu video, I guess I would like to be
invisible? It would be quite handy when I want to rob a bank or something
in the future.</p>
<p><strong>11) What other-people traits do you find attractive?</strong><br>
Umm...I like a person who likes to watch movies (like all types, foreign,
old black and white, today, etc). I guess I also like a person who I can
be playfully sarcastic with...that's always nice.</p>
<p><strong>12) What other-people traits drive you crazy?</strong><br>
I don't know...what's with all these ideal mate and what you find attractive
questions?</p>
<p><strong>13) What would be your first act after successfully taking over the
  world?</strong><br>
I would end world hunger and try to create world peace...does that sound
like a pageant answer?</p>
<p><strong>14) If you could go back in time and star in any movie, what role would
  you play?</strong><br>
The character, "Shiori" played by Erika Oda in the movie, "After Life,"
directed by Koreeda Hirokazu.</p>
<p><strong>15) What is your ultimate purpose in life?</strong><br>
I guess to find true happiness in whatever form that might be, but making
others happy is nice too. I don't know...I'm being indecisive right now...</p>
