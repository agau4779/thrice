<h4>Name?</h4>
Katherine Maslyn

<h4>Year & Major?</h4>
I am a 2nd year Business and perhaps English major.

<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>
This is my first.

<h4>What kind of stuff do you do for fun?</h4>
I like cooking in my new apartment and doing crossword puzzles during lecture.  I am addicted to <a href="http://cracked.com">Cracked.com</a>, and also to Craigslist Missed Connections.  I can play guitar and knit, but can do neither very well, and cannot do both simultaneously.  Yet.

<h4>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHY5L47tcHk">What powers, you ask?  I dunno, how 'bout the power of flight?  That do anything for ya?  That's levitation, homes.  How 'bout the power to kill a yak from 200 yards away...with MIND BULLETS?  That's telekinesis, Kyle.  How 'bout the power...to move you?</a>

<h4>What would your superhero name be?</h4>
Wondergirl.

<h4>What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</h4>
I have been a fangirl of Theatre Rice since I came to Cal, and I always thought the cast was full of amazing people.  I was right.  In my very first week in TR, I met a couple of playwrights, a few aspiring comedians, several talented musicians, and a boy with extremely large tonsils.

<h4>What would you say is your favorite movie?</h4>
I can be a pretty big LOTR nerd sometimes.

<h4>If you could be any common household electrical appliance, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
The FoodSaver®  V3840 Vacuum Sealer Kit.  Because I'm a keeper.

<h4>What was the last song you had stuck in your head?</h4>
"My Junk" from Spring Awakening, which is rapidly reaching an astronomical play count in my iTunes because I'm learning it for a possible Comedy Troupe musicale.

<h4>What's your favorite type of food?</h4>
I can never say "no" to anything with avocado in it.  I attend a biweekly Avocados Anonymous support group.

<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
Jack Black.  He meshes music with comedy, and he creates the most fantastic larger-than-life characters.  Sometimes I like to sing like Dewey Finn when I think nobody's watching.

<h4>Finally, sum yourself up in one word.</h4>
Enigmatic.
