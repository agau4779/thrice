<h4>Name?</h4>
Patricia Nguyen

<h4>Year & Major?</h4>
Sophomore, Intended Integrative Biology

<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>
Going on my third...wow, time goes by when you're having fun!

<h4>What kind of stuff do you do for fun?</h4>
I can watch movies all day. I also can eat all day. And when no one's home in my apartment, the music goes on and I just wiggle by myself. Imagine how awesome it would be to do all three. At once.

<h4>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
My superpower is Batman.
<br>
Because he's awesome and doesn't need superpowers to be the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one Gotham needs.

<h4>What would your superhero name be?</h4>
Batman

<h4>What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</h4>
Theatre and Rice. What else does one need for fun and survival?

<h4>What would you say is your favorite movie?</h4>
I would SAY my favorite movie of all time is Terminator 2: Judgment Day, simply because it is my FIRST favorite movie of all time. Otherwise, I have a list of favorite movies that continues to grow (the list currently has 162 items on it, but it's more of an approximate...ish.)

<h4>If you could be any common household electrical appliance, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
A toaster. Because it makes bread into toast, and toast is fantastic.

<h4>What was the last song you had stuck in your head?</h4>
A combo of Above & Beyond's 'Good For Me,' Rooney's 'When Did Your Heart Go Missing,' and ABBA's 'Lay All Your Love On Me.' All three at the same time.

<h4>What's your favorite type of food?</h4>
The kind of food you eat.

<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
Bale-Bonham-Carter-Caine-DiCaprio-Freeman-Jackman-Kidman-Ledger-Nicholson-Norton-Oldman-Pitt-Robbins-Spacey-Winslet-Zellweger. They all have one thing in common: their acting is unbelievably believable.
<br>
Of course, there are duds here and there; but still, they're awesome!


<h4>Finally, sum yourself up in one word.</h4>
Eclectic.
