<h4>Name?</h4>
Sasha Eng Wergeles

<h4>Year & Major?</h4>
Second year as-of-yet undeclared English major.

<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>
This is my second!

<h4>What kind of stuff do you do for fun?</h4>
I really love checking out visual art and listening to music of all genres. I also spend a lot of time scribbling in little notebooks. I'm always down for hiking or basketball or just being outdoors in general.

<h4>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
Selective mind-reading, so I could work the system even harder.

Psychoactive Sasha.

A chance Facebook invite from Ms. Joy Regullano. 

<h4>What would you say is your favorite movie?</h4>
Pulp Fiction.

<h4>If you could be any common household electrical appliance, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
A hairdryer, because it'd be cool to sort of look like a gun but just spew out hot air.

<h4>What was the last song you had stuck in your head?</h4>
Hmmm.... "Badfish" by Sublime.

<h4>What's your favorite type of food?</h4>
Macaroni and cheese will forever be my ultimate comfort food. But as far as "type" of food... Cheesy? Spicy? Crispy? Maybe I'll just go with Italian.

<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
Bob Dylan, because he deserves to be our poet laureate. 

<h4>Finally, sum yourself up in one word.</h4>
Surprise!
