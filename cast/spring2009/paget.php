<h4>Name?</h4>
Paget Kagy

<h4>Year & Major?</h4>
2009 History

<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>
This will be my 2nd.

<h4>What kind of stuff do you do for fun?</h4>
Singing, songwriting, writing, hiking, painting, traveling, having philosophical conversations about the meaning of life, love and all of that good stuff.

<h4>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
It would have to be teleportation but to be consistent with my photo, the Kiss of Death...But then I'd have to work on disarming charm and that's a lot of effort. Damn.

<h4>What would your superhero name be?</h4>
Pernicious Paget

<h4>What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</h4>
Initially, the mission statement. But the people kept me hooked.

<h4>What would you say is your favorite movie?</h4>
Highly dependent on my mood. I have a tendency to either like the more dark, serious films like Gladiator, Road to Perdition and Pan's Labyrinth, or the goofy romantic comedies like Bridget Jone's Diary, When Harry Met Sally and You've Got Mail. 

<h4>If you could be any common household electrical appliance, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
Vacuum cleaner. It's a dirty job, but somebody's gotta do it.

<h4>What was the last song you had stuck in your head?</h4>
Van Morrison - Days Like This

<h4>What's your favorite type of food?</h4>
Korean or Indian food...Kimchi and curry, yumm.

<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
Ella Fitzgerald. When she was on that stage, she commanded attention. Not by her looks, style or dress, but by her presence. Look at a video of her performing and you'll see how she immerses her entire body into each song. That's dedication and talent. 

<h4>Finally, sum yourself up in one word.</h4>
Go-Getter
