<h4>Name?</h4>

<h4>Year & Major?</h4>

<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>
5

<h4>What kind of stuff do you do for fun?</h4>
I like to play the guitar, watch tv, listen to music, play video games. Yeah, that sort of stuff. I also like to hang out with friends.

<h4>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
I'd like to shoot fire out of my hands. That way, if someone needs a light, I could say something like, "Need a light?" Oh StarCraft... 

<h4>What would your superhero name be?</h4>
"The Fire Starter".
<h4>What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</h4>
I feel like it's a matter of whom and not what because it was the people of TR that drew me to this place. I had never met a group of individuals so inviting and so talented in my life. I have a lot of fun there. With TR, I know I'm in the right place.

<h4>What would you say is your favorite movie?</h4>
That's a pretty hard question... I love watching movies. They're a great way to forget yourself for two hours. The last movie I enjoyed watching was Ocean's Thirteen. I don't know why, but I couldn't help but like it a lot.

<h4>If you could be any common household electrical appliance, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
I'd be a refrigerator. I don't know why. I like food, I guess.

<h4>What was the last song you had stuck in your head?</h4>
For a while, it was that one Rhianna song, "Disturbia", but after weeks of intense therapy, I think I've gotten over it.

<h4>What's your favorite type of food?</h4>
Italian cuisine

<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
KT Tunstall is a performer I admire. She's such a class act. I love the way she interacts with the audience and she puts herself into her music while onstage. Plus, she's such a badass. Did you know that she once had her guitar string go through her finger while performing? She didn't even stop to fix herself. That's pretty hard core if you ask me.

<h4>Finally, sum yourself up in one word.</h4>
Modest
