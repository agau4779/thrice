<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>
3 (including this one)

<h4>What kind of stuff do you do for fun?</h4>
hangout with friends, listen to music, watch movies, eating, going out, procrastinating from doing work

<h4>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
I would like to have telekinesis and be able to read minds. This way, I know what people are exactly thinking. 

<h4>What would your superhero name be?</h4>
Ace (as in Ace of Spades)

<h4>What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</h4>
I love the family aspect and the people. You actually get to know people and want to hangout with them outside of meetings. 

<h4>What would you say is your favorite movie?</h4>
"After Life," by Koreeda Hirokazu. It makes you wonder what memory you would want to take with you after you die. I was looking for a copy of this movie for 1.5 years (did not want to pay over $30 of it on Amazon). I finally found it in a mom-and-pop shop during winter break for $20 (better than $30 without including shipping and tax) :)

<h4>If you could be any common household electrical appliance, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
I think I would be a microwave because I can always warm you up, anytime, anywhere...as long as there is an outlet. 

<h4>What was the last song you had stuck in your head?</h4>
The Beatles, "Let it Be" and "Hey Jude."

<h4>What's your favorite type of food?</h4>
It depends on what kind of mood I am in. I can usually eat anything...edible.

<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
I love watching Matt Nathanson perform live. I think he is a great musician and really funny to watch. 

<h4>Finally, sum yourself up in one word.</h4>
Giggles
