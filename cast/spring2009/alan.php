<h4>Name?</h4>
Alejandro Antonio Joseph Navarrete Uy (or Alan, for short)

<h4>Year & Major?</h4>
Second Year / Civil Engineering

<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>
This begins my fourth!

<h4>What kind of stuff do you do for fun?</h4>
I wonder the city during rush hour, just riding any form of transportation.

<h4>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
The ability to control time. I could do anything with this power! I could pause time to appreciate more of the present; I could rewind time to see my histories; I could fast forward time to know what to study for... (NOT CHEATING- I would just "happen to know" what would be on the test... but I would still study...)

<h4>What would your superhero name be?</h4>
It's the same as my first name.

<h4>What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</h4>
Kathleen Mendoza... and, of course, my curiosity in art.

<h4>What would you say is your favorite movie?</h4>
I'll just name the unnamed movies that I decided to put down on Facebook:
<br>
5. Blame it on the Bellboy<br>
8. The Taking of the Pelham One, Two, Three<br>
10. Match Point<br>
12. Talk to Her<br>
13. Immortal Beloved<br>
14. Baby's Day Out<br>
16. Money Train



<h4>If you could be any common household electrical appliance, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
Freezer. I don't know why yet... but I love the cold.

<h4>What was the last song you had stuck in your head?</h4>
Oh dear, several...
<br>
1. Keke Palmer - How Do I Know<br>
2. Beethoven - Symphony No.3 (Eroica), Last Movement<br>
3. George Michael - Last Christmas<br>
4. Beethoven - Piano Sonata in D Minor, Last Movement<br>

<h4>What's your favorite type of food?</h4>
Anything with much spice... YUM!

<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
Ludwig van Beethoven. 
<br>
I guess I'm sort of biased right now since I'm taking a class entirely devoted to him. But Beethoven just exhibits the true meaning of Art. It just astounds me to think that most of his sonatas and even some symphonies were just developed from four to five simple notes or just a tonic chord and improvised.
<br>
Beethoven is the true improver; I respect and love all, but especially people who can improvise on the spot, and even more for people who can improvise with music.

<h4>Finally, sum yourself up in one word.</h4>

Rho.
