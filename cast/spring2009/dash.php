<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
Gene Kelly.  Because he's a serious bad ass.  The man could dance, act, and sing.  And unlike a lot of "dancers" today, he was a serious serious serious talent.  Also, singing in the rain is one of the greatest films ever.  For real; I wish I was more like Gene Kelly.
