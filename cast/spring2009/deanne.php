<h4>Name?</h4>
Deanne Chen

<h4>Year & Major?</h4>
Freshman, Undecided. 

<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>
I am a noob! 

<h4>What kind of stuff do you do for fun?</h4>
I like to turn my bass speakers up way loud and then jam to da muzik! That is, in my room….. when I’m alone. But other than that, you might see me dancing down the street sometimes, with my iPod. I also like inventing dance moves, awkward ones, preferably. 
<br>
I really like eating bacon. Especially when it’s extra crispy with lots of fat. Yes, I know it’s gross. There’s just no rhyme and reason to it.
<br>
If I have the time, I also really like to sketch and draw caricatures of people. I have a lot of fun just letting my imagination run wild on paper; drawing comics is just really fun for me. If there was a question on here that asked, “What is your dream job?”, I would definitely put being a cartoonist for The New Yorker!


<h4>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
I want to have Keanu Reeves’s power – the ability to look mixed-Asian and sexy. Oh, and I guess the whole lean back and dodge bullets in slow-motion would be a nice plus. 
<br>
Oh geez, there is a "why?" portion to this question. Well, I think wanting to look as sexy and cool as Keanu Reeves is implicitly justified. As for his acting skills... well, we can leave those out. 

<h4>What would your superhero name be?</h4>
The Deanne-trix.

<h4>What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</h4>
The attractive people in it. Ha, ha, ha… ok weak joke. Moving on!
<br>
Theatre Rice is just a really great way to expel all the creativity that has been suppressed inside of you for years. Have you ever looked out onto the 500+ people in your lecture and just wanted to scream, "Nooooo!!! I am special and distinct! Even though Berkeley has 12,000 or so intelligent students and I am really just an ant among the collegiate masses!" Well, then Theatre Rice is perfect for you! The best part of Theatre Rice is its friendly, open community that allows you to express your own unique voice through performance. So yay! I am special after all!

<h4>What would you say is your favorite movie?</h4>
Roman Holiday!!!!! Gregory Peck is just a gorgeous hunk of a man. And Audrey Hepburn is my idol. I wish I were petite, elegant, and elfin with nicely defined eyebrows… Plus, it is the only movie I have ever seen that makes gelato look so good. If you have seen it, there’s this one part where Audrey Hepburn gets a haircut and eats gelato, sitting on a ledge of this really famous square in Italy. And then she runs into Gregory Peck again! *girly squeal!* When I went to Italy, that was the first thing I did – well, the eating gelato and sitting in the square part… not the meeting Gregory Peck part… *runs away to go cry in a corner*

<h4>If you could be any common household electrical appliance, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
The mixer!!!! Because I love dancing!!!! *doo doo TSCH!* Alright, but seriously, I say the mixer mostly because I tend to use it whenever I am baking cookies. So I just want to be in contact with cookie batter all the time. Mmmm.... cookie batter. What, salmonella poisoning, you say? Pish Posh!

<h4>What was the last song you had stuck in your head?</h4>
“Sweaty” by Muscles. It is a much more appealing song than the title sounds. 

<h4>What's your favorite type of food?</h4>
The bacon-type. Like I said, preferably with extra-crisp, extra-fat, and extra baconess. Actually, this would be my <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/28/dining/28bacon.html?_r=1&scp=2&sq=bacon%20log&st=cse">dream meal...</a>
<br>
Other than that, I like all types of food: from Mexican to Chinese to Korean to Japanese to French to Italian to Thai to Ethiopian.... I can go on forever.

<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
Ryan Stiles of “Who’s Line Is It Anyway?”. He’s just tall and funny-looking. I guess you could say he inspired me to do comedy, he is so hilarious. If you have ever seen the episode where he had to enact “a foal being born,” or when he did “a man aging backwards” you would completely agree. And he wears really awesome shoes.

<h4>Finally, sum yourself up in one word.</h4>
In the spirit of The Simpsons (aka: the best show ever): Ay-Caramba!
