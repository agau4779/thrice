<h4>Name?</h4>
Christy Yang

<h4>Year & Major?</h4>
Junior -IB (but I want to do industrial designing!)

<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>
4
<h4>What kind of stuff do you do for fun?</h4>
I love people watching haha, I would enjoy just sitting in a coffee shop sipping on some nice tea and observe the world around me. It's very interesting to get different perspectives on life just by watching. 
<br>I love music...and will listen to an album for a week straight before moving onto another album (yes...I listen to albums instead of singles or songs on shuffle). I have an addiction to the show Brothers and Sisters :)
<br>And right now, I have been immersing myself in photography as my way of self expression. 

<h4>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
I would LOVE to be able to speak all the languages there are! To be able to understand someone in their native tongue is such an invaluable skill. It also spans to animals and plants (assuming they communicate with each other)...wouldn't it be amazing to talk to anyone and everyone without limitations? 

<h4>What would your superhero name be?</h4>
Omnilinguist! (yeah ok I dunno)

<h4>What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</h4>
Well...the first meeting was pretty epic. 
<br>And I keep coming back because of the people.

<h4>What would you say is your favorite movie?</h4>
Oh wow I have a slew. They are of all different genres...Shawshank Redemption (from my father), Dead Poets Society, Good Will Hunting, Amelie, Definitely Maybe, Nightmare Before Christmas....

<h4>If you could be any common household electrical appliance, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
I would be your lamp...to light your way ;)

<h4>What was the last song you had stuck in your head?</h4>
Almost Lover- by A Fine Frenzy

<h4>What's your favorite type of food?</h4>
Spicy. 


<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
I have always admired Angelina Jolie but there really isn't a concrete reason for it. I see her as such a sexy, sophisticated woman. She grew into that, which I think is part of her appeal to me. She found herself after a very 'experimental' past, and I respect that. 

<h4>Finally, sum yourself up in one word.</h4>
Pensive
