<h4>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
<!--morphing into other people.... so i could have their powers too. <br>
like Rogue in X-Men. :]-->
The power to manipulate my voice. I could sing a beautiful lullaby to make people fall asleep, or a hypnotic and siren-like song to make enemies succumb to my power, or a loud, screeching noise that physically hurts the bad guys. I'd also have the ability to talk so softly, as if I was mentally talking to one person, or so loudly that everyone, everywhere can hear what I'm saying.

<h4>What would your superhero name be?</h4>
krishmagic.

<h4>What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</h4>
I randomly ran into Varun one night, and he told me that he was practicing for his Theatre Rice show all week, and that I should check it out, especially since I like performing. So I made all my floormates come with me to watch their first show that semester, and the whole time we were watching it I just kept thinking, "I need to be up there....I need to be in this group...."

<h4>What would you say is your favorite movie?</h4>
it's hard to say because there are different categories... so it's like a three-way tie between Cruel Intentions, A lot Like Love, and the Butterfly Effect.

<h4>If you could be any common household electrical appliance, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
a blender. cuz i like to shake things up. :p

<h4>What was the last song you had stuck in your head?</h4>
"i hate this part" by the pussycat dolls. i blame yuner for singing it.

<h4>What's your favorite type of food?</h4>
those green manzanilla olives that they serve in martinis. yummm.

<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
my sister. even though she's naturally an amazing actress and singer, she still works on ways to improve and expand, even if it means going out of her comfort zone.

<h4>Finally, sum yourself up in one word.</h4>
charismatic~
