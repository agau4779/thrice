<h4>Name?</h4>
Joy Regullano

<h4>Year & Major?</h4>
2nd year, Southeast Asian Studies major, Theater Minor

<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>
this is my 4th one!

<h4>What kind of stuff do you do for fun?</h4>
cook. eat. read. write. music. procrastinate (i'm sorry for sending this in so late, jacek!  [No problem, haha]).

<h4>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
to know what people are thinking. then i'd be the ultimate manipulator! and it'd be so much easier to get jobs, or make friends, etc.

<h4>What would your superhero name be?</h4>
hungry joy?

<h4>What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</h4>
i knew one of the Ricers in high school, and so i decided to check out the first meeting. but after that, it was the energy, sense of family, and ability to express myself creatively that kept me coming back.

<h4>What would you say is your favorite movie?</h4>
the iron giant, hands down. it represents everything i would want out of a career in entertainment--wide appeal (to adults and kids) and comedy wrapped up in a very serious message.

<h4>If you could be any common household electrical appliance, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
a toaster oven, because... i like things crispy?

<h4>What was the last song you had stuck in your head?</h4>
living on a prayer, by bon jovi

<h4>What's your favorite type of food?</h4>
oh man, asian cuisine hands down. i love so much of it... Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Filipino, Japanese...

<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
Lea Salonga. She's Filipino, but she broke into the mainstream with her sheer talent and gets cast in roles that traditionally are thought of as "Caucasian" ones. 

<h4>Finally, sum yourself up in one word.</h4>
joy.
