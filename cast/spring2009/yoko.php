<h4>Name?</h4>
Yoko Elaine Nagayama

<h4>Year & Major?</h4>
4th year, Molecular Environmental Biology

<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>
This will be my first. 

<h4>What kind of stuff do you do for fun?</h4>
Any combination of the following: friends, food, movies, SF, dancing, and laughing.

<h4>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
Teleportation. Because I'm always late to things, and having this superpower will eliminate that. I think. After acquiring said superpower, I might teleport too late... hmm, manipulating time might be better... reading minds would be cool too... (fyi photo was taken while debating between the three)

<h4>What would your superhero name be?</h4>
The Great Mind-Reading Time-Bending Space-Traveling Girl. Bit of an identity crisis.

<h4>What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</h4>
It wasn't really an attraction, to be honest, it was more like a set up. My brother took me to a show, and I didn't like it at first - too loud, too outrageous, too...funny. But after a few more dates, I realized how wonderful it is, and, to tell the truth, I fell in love. Now I can't bear to be apart from it! That and the beautiful amazing talented performers in it. They're cool too.

<h4>What would you say is your favorite movie?</h4>
That's hard. That's like picking your favorite child. If I HAD to choose, it would be a six-way tie between Saved!, Amelie, Princess Bride, Eternal Sunshine, Moulin Rouge and Leon. Does that count?

<h4>If you could be any common household electrical appliance, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
A toaster oven, because they are versatile and very useful (Toast! Bake! Broil! Reheat last night's pizza! Make s'mores without a campfire!). They're pretty much awesome.

<h4>What was the last song you had stuck in your head?</h4>
Would I lie to you?' by Eurythmics. It was in my head when I woke up this morning.

<h4>What's your favorite type of food?</h4>
Again, like picking a favorite child. I'll keep it simple by saying I love eating with friends, I ain't picky, and I have a terrible sweet tooth.

<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
Margaret Cho, because she is fearless and speaks her mind.

<h4>Finally, sum yourself up in one word.</h4>
curious.
