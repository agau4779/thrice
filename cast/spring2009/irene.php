I heard from a friend at Berkeley before I came here and I have been addicted since. The people are amazing and ones that I can call my friends even outside of TR.  Also, I love the shows!

<h4>What would you say is your favorite movie?</h4>
The Departed...as of now. Bad ass Mark Wahlberg? Leonardo DiCaprio and a hot sex scene with him in it? I mean, come on, thats all I need.

A toaster...because it makes things so crispy, tasty, and warm. And it completes any meal.  Who wants a soggy plain untoasted sandwich anyway?

Vietnamese food.  Its the only one that I ever really miss.

<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
More recently, I've been really inspired by Mush, a Korean-American spoken word poet. She has a way with talking to the audience and making people feel exactly how she wants them to feel.  Also, I hella had to hold back tears on one of her poems. She's great.

<h4>Finally, sum yourself up in one word.</h4>
Spunky
