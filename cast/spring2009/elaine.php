<h4>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
I would want the power to turn anything I touch into skittles... I lied... I would want the power to move things without touching them so I can mess with people by playing pranks and blame it on others. And also because if something is too far away, I can just point and drag it towards me, thus increasing my body's inactivity. XD

<h4>What would your superhero name be?</h4>
CAT-tastrophe Girl

<h4>What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</h4>
When I saw the videos on TR's Youtube channel, I thought their productions to be so creative and hilarious and I said to myself why not get in on the act? =D

<h4>What would you say is your favorite movie?</h4>
Slumdog Millionaire. I laughed. I cried. I got pissed off. Got hopeful. Got pissed off again. Cried again. And then cried out of happiness. Hella epic. 

<h4>If you could be any common household electrical appliance, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
A toaster. I will toast your buns and pop you out. 

<h4>What was the last song you had stuck in your head?</h4>
Flyleaf - So Sick

<h4>What's your favorite type of food?</h4>
I love burritos because inside of them are little party favors like bell peppers, onions, rice, spices, guacamole, corn, cheese, sour creme, mild, spicy, lettuce, tomatoes, all wrapped together to explode as a fiesta in my mouth -- I just described a Chipotle burrito. 

<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
Björk. She has a presence unlike anyone I've ever heard or seen. She's different and not afraid to express herself. She takes risks and delivers beautiful and artistic results. Her songs come from her heart and her passion. 

<h4>Finally, sum yourself up in one word.</h4>
Thoughtful
