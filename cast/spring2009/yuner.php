<h4>Name?</h4>

<h4>Year & Major?</h4>

<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>
First one <3

<h4>What kind of stuff do you do for fun?</h4>
I like to dance and sing and act. I also love to bake, especially when I am stressed. I like to read (short stories ftw). I love exploring places and looking at pretty things. I really like to talk about random intellectual things. Or just random things, I suppose. I also enjoy talking to my 14 moose. 

<h4>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
INVISIBILITY. Then I could do all sorts of things and never get in trouble for it. Plus I could scare my friends all the time by just appearing in their face. 

<h4>What would your superhero name be?</h4>
Transparent Chick

<h4>What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</h4>
I really love the work that Theatre Rice does. My favourite of all is Darkness, My Old Friend.

<h4>What would you say is your favorite movie?</h4>
Love Me If You Dare, a whimsical French movie about insane love that is both cutesy and adult. That Youngster is So Hot (very rough translation), a Korean romance, comes in a very close second.

<h4>If you could be any common household electrical appliance, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
A radiator or a heater, because I would make people feel warm and happy on a cold day.

<h4>What was the last song you had stuck in your head?</h4>
You Picked Me by A Fine Frenzy.

<h4>What's your favorite type of food?</h4>
Singaporean :D

<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
Edward Norton. He completely freaked me out (in a good way) in Primal Fear. Anyone who can play two personalities right next to each other convincingly is amazing in my book. He is also a method actor I think, which I think shows real commitment to acting.

<h4>Finally, sum yourself up in one word.</h4>
Bouncy
