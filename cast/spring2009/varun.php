<br>
I love hanging out with friends, going out, watching television marathons and movies with friends, taking long walks on the beach.  I love spending time with people in general, actually =)

<h4>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
X-Ray vision to see through things.  Like walls, because I think it would be useful to know who's next door.  And fabrics, because I think it would be highly amusing.

<h4>What would your superhero name be?</h4>
Vroom-Vroom Varun!

<h4>What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</h4>
Awesome publicity, fliers, and three generations of Leland High School Speech and Debate alums.

<h4>What would you say is your favorite movie?</h4>
Forrest Gump, Coming to America, Mrs. Doubtfire are all amazing.<br>
But by far, my favorite movie is "Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2."<br>
Thanks to Dash for introducing me to that epic film.

<h4>If you could be any common household electrical appliance, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
I'd be a washing machine and a dryer as a set, because I'm so fresh and so clean.

"I'm on a Boat" by The Lonely Island and T-Pain.

<h4>What's your favorite type of food?</h4>
I'm craving some home-cooked, fresh of the stove, hot and spicy South Indian food.<br>
No cooking like my mom's.

<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
DMX.  I'm actually not a big fan, but it astonishes me that someone in this day and age can be that ignorant and still roll in the dough.<br>
I guess I don't really admire him for it.  But I do think it's quite an accomplishment.<br>
