<h4>Name?</h4>

<h4>Year & Major?</h4>

<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>
Lucky number 3!

<h4>What kind of stuff do you do for fun?</h4>
That's a pretty loaded question...making to-do lists, baking yummy stuff, eating, farting, burping, scribbling in my notebooks, leaving "note to self' recordings on my tape recorder, grocery shopping, picking lint from my toes, having coffee at Cafe Milano, sleeping, cuddling, being awake at 3 am, crawling into bed with others, being cheesy, buying plants, dancing, moving, pooing, reading and pooing, having fun fun fun, getting lost in music, filling out questionnaires about myself so that everyone can know what kind of person I am so that they'll think, "Oh, she's interesting..." 

<h4>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
Selective mind-reading. I want to know everyone's thoughts, but only if I'm involved in them. I could care less what everyone thinks about everything else, but if it pertains to me, hell yeah I wanna know! 

<h4>What would your superhero name be?</h4>
Errrrkkkkahhhhhhhhh!!

<h4>What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</h4>
The sex....y people! And of course, the Theatre. And the rice! 

<h4>What would you say is your favorite movie?</h4>
The one I'm going to make. That and Gone with the Wind. 

<h4>If you could be any common household electrical appliance, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
Let's be honest here: I'd be a vibrator because then I'd bring pleasure to women. And some men. I like it when people are happy and fulfilled. (:

<h4>What was the last song you had stuck in your head?</h4>
Make Me A Channel of Your Peace. <br>

It's a church song and it's amazing. Seriously. Look up the lyrics. It's the Prayer of St. Francis and it'll change your life. 

<h4>What's your favorite type of food?</h4>
In all honesty, I can't really limit myself to any single "type." But if I really had to, well, you can never go wrong with Italian. Or Indian. Or Filipino. Or...well, the list continues. 

<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
Seriously...Carey Grant. Just because he has that swagger and the gentleman-ness and that 1940's movie voice. Plus he's an amazing actor. And those eyes that stare at me in black and white...be still my beating heart! 

<h4>Finally, sum yourself up in one word.</h4>
YELLOW!
