<h4>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
Power of influence/persuasion. I would be able to use my eyes and stare

I thought it was an actual theater full of rice. and boy do i like rice!

and read the list that goes on for days. I just watched secret life of
bees and gosh, it was amazing!
<h4>If you could be any common household electrical appliance, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
Um, a hair dryer? Because I produce 'wind in the hair' looks. In layman's

produce warmth. AND, that's how my farts feel like!

So what! Pink
