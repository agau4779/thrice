<h4>Name?</h4>

<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>
4

<h4>What kind of stuff do you do for fun?</h4>
eat, daydream, video games, television, inter-web, movies, sports, read, cook, music, wiggle, sleep, goof off, giggle, children's card games, dance, sing, jiggle.

<h4>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
I would like to be an airbender (SEE <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender">AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER</a>). Well, I would prefer to master air, water, earth and fire, but airbending would be my top choice. I could use it to fly, create huge air bubbles to breath underwater, create cyclones and tempests, and for some apparent reason, be able to run really fast.

<h4>What would your superhero name be?</h4>
Avatar &#x6740e

<h4>What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</h4>
When the wind dies down and the dust settles, it's the people that keep me coming back.

<h4>What would you say is your favorite movie?</h4>
Childhood Favorites: Rush Hour 2 and the first two Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Movies.

<h4>If you could be any common household electrical appliance, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
Electric Razor. Is that common? I just really need to shave my facial hair right now.

<h4>What was the last song you had stuck in your head?</h4>
Can I Have This Dance (Reprise)<br>
I'm lame. Deal with it.

<h4>What's your favorite type of food?</h4>
Depends on my mood. I eat anything. Mum and pop call me a garbage can.

<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
While there are many performers that I do admire - actors, athletes, musicians - I don't know what they're like as people. And every semester, with the exception of my first one, when I've been asked this question for the TR website, the first group of people that pop into my mind are the cast members in Rice. I know who they are and where they're from, how they work and what they do. So, as per semesters past, I'd have to say I admire everyone I've seen work and grow in Theatre Rice.

I copped out this semester and didn't chose only one performer haha.

<h4>Finally, sum yourself up in one word.</h4>
