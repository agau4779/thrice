<h4>Name?</h4>
Jacek.

<h4>Year & Major?</h4>
Third Year.  Electrical Engineering.  Computer Science.  Math.  Yup.

<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!  So IV.  Counting this semester.

<h4>What kind of stuff do you do for fun?</h4>
All kinds.  I like to act, but it's hardly all I do.  I'm a swimmer, a writer, a graphic designer, a ukulele-player, a dancer, and I'm no longer allowed to step foot in 34 of the 48 contiguous states.  Just kidding about that last part.  Maybe.

<h4>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
Barring some kind of wickedly awesome all-encompassing time-and-space-control power, I'd stick with psychokinesis, which, according to wikipedia, is kinda like telekinesis except that it includes power over energy as well as matter.  That's funky.

<h4>What would your superhero name be?</h4>
Doctor Excellent.

<h4>What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</h4>
Anthony Wee, Yue Tu, Elita Wong, Jim Chin.  The rest is history!

<h4>What would you say is your favorite movie?</h4>
Hard to say, but I really enjoyed <b>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</b>.

<h4>If you could be any common household electrical appliance, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
A taser.  I know, right?  How shocking!  (I had to.)

<h4>What was the last song you had stuck in your head?</h4>
A few.  Last song that was stuck in my head?  Thanks to Varun (and now me) singing it over and over again for the past week or so, it's:  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mRhMIzyhRE"> Jamie Foxx - Blame It (ft. T-Pain)</a>.
<br>…and of course <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7yfISlGLNU">Lonely Island - I'm On a Boat</a> and the great <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR6W4QzfMaY">Michael Jackson - Wanna Be Startin' Something</a>.

<h4>What's your favorite type of food?</h4>
I always try to try new kinds of food, but I'm always in the mood for a good smoothie.

<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
Robert Downey Jr.  Consider what <b>Iron Man</b> would be without him:  a pretty mediocre superhero action movie.  He made it awesome.  He also made <b>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</b> awesome before that.  Therefore, he's pretty awesome.

<h4>Finally, sum yourself up in one word.</h4>
Yes.
