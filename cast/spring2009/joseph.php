<h4>Name?</h4>

<h4>How many semesters have you been in Theatre Rice?</h4>
2

<h4>What kind of stuff do you do for fun?</h4>
I like to draw, act, game, sing, dance, watch anime and tv shows, play a casual game of poker, sit and do nothing, and other more personal things

<h4>If you could have any superpower, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
'Super speed'. Not so long ago I used to day dream a lot about my alter ego or my residual self-image Aeroscythe the Stormassassin. I loved just imagining myself becoming him in awesome fucking ways (like lighting striking me transforming me into a pro-ass assassin with a costume and weapon) and then owning the fuck out of everyone. I actually wrote up stats on him ('super speed' lightning and wind based attacks) and his equips because I’m a nerd like that. I actually use my alter ego for a lot fun things I do like game account names, aim, art projects aeroscythe.deviantart.com , and even at TR Open Rice Night. 

<h4>What would your superhero name be?</h4>
Aeroscythe

<h4>What attracted you to Theatre Rice?</h4>
I love to act and Theatre Rice is fun. I learned a lot from my first semester in TR and I'd say that it was one of my best semesters at Berkeley. Being in TR allowed me to discover the magic of being on stage. Performing in front of a huge audience is the greatest feeling I've ever experienced (a huge reason is because I commit myself to my characters to the max when I act on stage and when I really become him there is something about it that feels awesome). I definitely want to do more shows and experience stage time again.

<h4>What would you say is your favorite movie?</h4>
Princess Bride. Love, Action, Adventure, Great storyline. It has all the good stuff that I love. And I love Princess Bride a lot.

<h4>If you could be any common household electrical appliance, what would it be?  Why?</h4>
I'd be your face. Because I own your face.

<h4>What was the last song you had stuck in your head?</h4>
Digital Love is my favorite song. I like dancing to dance music sometimes.

<h4>What's your favorite type of food?</h4>
Shanghainese food is the best. In 'n' out is pretty good too.

<h4>Name a performer you admire.  Why did you choose him/her?</h4>
Dave Chappelle. He is a god of comedy and I want to see him do more stuff. He uses the best kind of humor, hes honest, and he has intention.

<h4>Finally, sum yourself up in one word.</h4>
Sup.
