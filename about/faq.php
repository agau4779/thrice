			<h4>
				What is Theatre Rice?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Theatre Rice is the first modern Asian American Theatre Group on the UC Berkeley Campus, established in 1998. Theatre Rice was founded for two reasons: to help combat the misrepresentation of Asian Americans in popular culture and in various forms of media (i.e. film, television, etc.) and to promote Asian Americans in the performing arts. The stage has historically been off-limits to Asian Americans, and Theatre Rice is changing this by promoting Asian American performing arts on the UC Berkeley Campus.
			</p>
			<h4>
				What does Theatre Rice do?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Theatre Rice performs sketch comedy, drama, improvisational comedy, plays, music, song, dance, spoken word, poetry, monologues, and many other types of performance. Theatre Rice prides itself in being completely self-produced. This means that everything in a Theatre Rice show is either written by Theatre Rice cast members or is submitted by other Asian American or non-Asian American writers to Theatre Rice. All of the props, costumes, and technical work are done by Theatre Rice cast members. We have two major shows per semester: a Midsemester Show and end-of-semester Performing Arts Showcase. Each of these shows performs to sold-out crowds in 155 Dwinelle. We have approximately 480 students attending our shows each night of performance.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Do I have to know how to act in order to join Theatre Rice?
			</h4>
			<p>
			Simply put: no. One of the key elements of being a Theatre Rice cast member is commitment and dedication to the group instead of innate talent or acting ability. In fact, very few of Theatre Rice's cast members are actually Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies majors; most of us come from a broad range of backgrounds, majors, and experiences. Theatre Rice fosters an environment where everyone is learning from each other in a very safe place.

			<h4>
				How do I join Theatre Rice?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Please attend our First General Meeting and you can get a taste of how Theatre Rice runs. At the end of the meeting, we will pass out a questionnaire and there will be sign-ups for auditions (time and location TBA). It is very important that you attend this meeting because this is the only time that you can sign up for an audition slot. At the audition we will collect your questionnaire and watch you perform a 1-minute monologue of anything of your choosing. Afterwards, we will ask you a few questions to get to know you.
			</p>
			<h4>
				How much of a time commitment is Theatre Rice?
			</h4>
			<p>
				We have 2.5-3 hour general meetings twice a week (7:00-9:30 or 10:00 PM), Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the week before a show, due to rehearsals and outside meetings, we put in 40 hours that whole week. In general Theatre Rice takes up a lot of time. It is highly recommended that members stay on top of their class work so their grades do not suffer.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Do I have to be Asian or Asian American to join Theatre Rice?
			</h4>
			<p>
				No! We call ourselves a modern Asian American theatre group because we promote Asian Americans in the performing arts. However, we do not exclude people of other backgrounds from our group.

			<h4>
				How many new members are you allowing into Theatre Rice?
			</h4>
			<p>
				The number of new members we are allowing into Theatre Rice will depend on how many people audition. We generally like to keep the group size around 40 members.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Is Theatre Rice affiliated with the Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies Department?
			</h4>
			<p>
				No. Theatre Rice is a student-run organization that receives funding from the ASUC and through our own fundraising.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Are there other performing arts groups on campus?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Yes. However, Theatre Rice is one of the few active student groups that specialize in theatre. There are other groups that specialize in dance (The Movement, Danceworks) and singing (Decadence, Men's Octet). If you are interested primarily in song or dance, Theatre Rice may not be the group for you to join. TBD is another comedy troupe on campus. Please visit these respective groups' websites for more information on auditions, sign-ups, etc.
			</p>
			<h4>
				How do I join Theatre Rice's Improv Troupe, Comedy Troupe, or other performing arts pieces?
			</h4>
			<p>
				When auditioning for Theatre Rice, you are auditioning for membership into the group, not for a specific part in the group. After you are accepted to the group, you have the opportunity to participate in Improv Troupe, Comedy Troupe, or other performance pieces. Acceptance to these different performance groups within Theatre Rice is up to the discretion of the directors (there may or may not be auditions for these groups). Generally speaking, Comedy Troupe and Improv Troupe are restricted to Theatre Rice cast members, while the directors of plays and other pieces may or may not have open auditions. As of October 2003, Improv Troupe is not guaranteed to perform every semester.
