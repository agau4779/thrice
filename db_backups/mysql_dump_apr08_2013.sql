','film troupe:\r\ni think the direction was not effective. the director did not\r\ndirect the actors but rather re-enacted what he wanted and the\r\nactors were told to copy. It was indicated at the beginning it\r\nwas going to be a group effort and that suggestions for the\r\nscript were going to be taken. there was none of that. in fact\r\nwhen anyone did bring up suggestions or disagreed with the\r\ndirector they were received with a negative attitude or were\r\ncompletely dismissed. some times even blatantly and rudely\r\nbrushed off. Many times i and other members of the group were\r\nleft offended and angered. no one appreciates being talked down\r\nupon or yelled at. i think if this kinda of situation happens\r\nagain, ex-comm should intervene and talk to the director. ','the format was great. it was fun. however i think the group would\r\nbenefit from a uniform repeated warm up. if the group did a set\r\nfew (1-2)warm up every meeting that focused on projection,\r\nbreathing, and body, it would help extremely. since we do random\r\ngames every meeting, nothing is really being achieved. no one is\r\nproperly learning about breathing and voice. which is extremely\r\nimportant considering we\'re a theatre group. ','i\'d really like to see more self written work and scripted work\r\nthat has an actual beginning and ending. not just a scene from a\r\nfull length play. if we\'re going to do scripted work, lets do it\r\nright. do a short play from beginning to end, and get the rights.\r\nwe can afford it. its not that expensive, especially if its short\r\nand we\'re only doing it for two nights. \r\nin terms of exercises, i think a breathing and voice exercise is\r\n really key. like doing the same three tongue twisters each time.\r\nand doing a relaxation breathing exercise. also, if we\'re going\r\nto do a lightening circle, it needs to be emphasized that the\r\npoint of the lightening circle isn\'t just to go super fast. but\r\nto go right after the person before you and mimic that action\r\nperfectly. its about precision,watching another person, and\r\nseeing the intricate details. however this is just my opinion. \r\nand i am definitely interested in directing a scripted piece. how\r\ncan i propose that?','yes i did. i wish i could have gotten to know more ppl, but with\r\na cast of 40, i think it was pretty good. ','yes for midsemester. not really for showcase. i really had to\r\nfight hard with the director to get my voice heard. but the\r\ncococo\'s were awesome, and so was assprod and prod, as well as\r\nCT. everything was great. ','yes. i heart rice. ','i want to direct something in rice and have wanted to for quite\r\nsometime now, but haven\'t found a project to really want to direct. ','just be a little more organized with the constitution meeting.\r\nsome people seem to have really gotten annoyed with that. i\r\ndidn\'t, but i understand why. but i think he handled it well by\r\nadmitting he made a mistake. no ones perfect. and overall i think\r\nhe did a great job. he was friendly, but still got the work done.','like i said earlier, a voice and projection excercise done at\r\nevery meeting will really help with rice. not to mention decrease\r\nthe amount to yelling \"project\" when showtime comes around. its\r\nsomething that needs to be taught and practiced. not just shouted\r\nout from the audience. that tends to ppl just shouting and\r\nstraining voices. Also i\'d like to see plays and self written\r\nwork be rehearsed and worked on for at least a month and a half.\r\nnot 3 and half weeks. its just not enough time to properly put on\r\na show. two months would be even better, especially with scripted\r\nwork. '),(8,'I think it went pretty well.  My only comment about this is\r\ncontinuing the gung-ho-ness into Showcase if there are two shows.','I felt that each director had their own way of doing things, but\r\nthis is great because it adds to the flavor of Rice.  I think\r\nsomething more could be done in the beginning with the old ricers\r\nto reach out to the new and create a more inclusive community,\r\nthat much sooner.','I love it.  Janelle and J\'amores were awesome.  I would kinda\r\nlike a teaser at the end so we know what to expect (so as to also\r\nmake the sessions seem connected more).','Anything that takes Theatre Rice outside the box is something\r\nthat I would look into.  I was thinking about some form of a\r\ntroupe where props become the focus of various stories or writing\r\nsomething for submission about various facets of what it means to\r\nbe a college student.','I felt comfortable with the group, but I felt connected with the\r\ngroup only after the second show as the different groups made the\r\ngroup as a whole seem very disconnected.  There were a lot of\r\ncliches, which though inevitable, might be minimized somehow.','I feel as though Theatre Rice, despite what\'s happened, is a most\r\ndemocratic organization.','I do because it is the one place where I feel loved and accepted\r\nat Cal... seriously.','I have accomplished my goals this semester.  I look forward to\r\naccomplishing new goals next semester.','I feel as though the Producer could have worked on elections\r\nbetter to make them more equitable and secure.  This said, he is\r\nable to admit mistakes, so that he and we can all learn from\r\nthem.  I couldn\'t think of anyone better from the group at this time.','I want to see Theatre Rice do more experimentation and/or come up\r\nwith material that is even more solid.'),(9,'Strengths: Staff were all leaders.\r\nWeaknesses: Wish there were more time to focus on a specific topic on specific days.  \r\n                    Felt like there were too much events with different goals.\r\n                    Learn more about Asian Americans in Theatre/Film.\r\n                    Lacking in Tech','Improv\r\nStrength: Spent a lot of time together to feel each other out.\r\nWeaknesses: Wish we got to watch professional improvers\r\n                    study/hang out by watching improv shows','The class format was what you expect from a theater class.  I feel the effectiveness was \r\nlimited by the space of the room.  Whenever we make a circle, it\'s difficult to do \r\nexercises because of the lack of room.  Perhaps make use of groups more.  Pick certain \r\nleaders and sections of the room to do different exercises.  Then make use of the the \r\ngigantic circle.','I\'d like to see a tech section/group.\r\n\r\nI may be interested in directing a short 5 minute piece that deals with the Term \r\nOriental for the Final Semester Showcase.','I do not think I can answer this fairly.  I am never comfortable with a group of people.  ','I noticed the old ricers\' ideas were voiced more.  I also heard the wanting of \r\nencouraging new ricers to voice ideas, but the considerations of the new ricers were \r\nnot taken in as much of old ricers.','No.  It is an artistic group I wanted to join from the start of college, but right now what \r\nI  can do is just follow.  I want to build my own confidence in myself and learn more \r\nbefore I join again.  I\'d like to do more than follow.  I want to contribute.','Yes.

A problem we\'ve had in the past is running out of time to critique peoples\' work because we simply don\'t have enough time in our one hour. I hope that by posting work in advance, we can come to the meeting ready with feedback so that we can move quickly and efficiently.\n\nBut before I go into that, let me launch into an explanation about what Writer\'s Block is about. Its purpose was originally to help members of Theatre Rice! and the community prepare work for Theatre RIce\'s Showcase, which this semester, happens on Nov. 7-8. That includes anything from a musical number to a play to a short film. Over the years, though, we\'ve expanded into being a place where anyone can come to develop any work, not just for Showcase. Heck, you don\'t even need to be working on something to come--you can just soak in the creative juices and be inspired. Come alone. Bring your friends. Whatever. We\'ll have a great time. [=\n\nNow for some forum rules. I think that anyone here should already know what type of behavior is expected, but I think there\'s basically one big rule: [b:1vsvxvp6]be supportive. This is a safe space, and keep your criticism as constructive as possible.

I had all these intense feelings brewing within me and I grabbed my pen, my weapon of mass destruction and my ultimate mode of survival in times like these, and I began to write furiously. This is what my mind came up with, driven by my heart. \n\nSometimes the thoughts go up and down,\nSometimes they linger on.\nMy emotions bounce around\nAnd I\'m awake til dawn. \nOther times I\'m so numb and gone, \nAt times I disappear\nAnd all I want is life to be done,\nI just can\'t stand it here. \nI will survive another day,\nI will continue to breathe air\nCause I know there is no way\nto leave and to be fair. \n\nAnd here\'s another...\n\nThere are days and there are nights,\nThere are a thousand city lights.\nHere I\'m awake in my bed,\nI know that I should sleep instead. \nBut the woe is ever there,\nIn the dark my eyes do stare. \nShadows of those memories \nthat my heart cannot release. \nI am broken and in pieces\nthough I call and pray to Jesus.\nThe god I loved is silent now \nand my mind will not allow\nany good thoughts to enter it\nAnd this is why I feel like shit.\nHopeful now, I\'d like to say\n&quot;Tomorrow is another day.&quot;\n\nAnd this one is more me musing rather than a poem, but it somehow turned poetic in its own way.\n\nWhat is bipolar? I ask myself this. No answers really come to mind. Is it something I can fix with time or is it there, forever a scar that won\'t go away, that\'s there to stay until my body goes to the worms? In that case, I\'ll be cremated cause those worms are dreadful. I know they don\'t mean harm. They just need food, but I don\'t want to be in their stomachs. \n\nA little morbid, huh? But hey, morbid was what I felt at the moment and if in that moment I could somehow be inspired, I\'ll take that feeling and turn it into something that I can look back on and say, &quot;Huh, well at least I was being productive and creative. \n\nUnfortunately, I cannot make it to this week\'s Writer\'s Block, but I hope to be around more often. Hope you enjoyed this tidbit of insight into my mind!!\n\n-Erika','96484b472b2751db2b8925fba283ea3a',0,'','3rk4f6bp',1,0,'',0,0,0),(7,7,3,57,0,'89.109.63.1',1229301413,1,0,1,1,1,1,'','qwtqwt','qwt qwt qwt qw','68a790f75da3a642fb69cdfb91be6958',0,'','m9tnco4a',1,0,'',0,0,0);
