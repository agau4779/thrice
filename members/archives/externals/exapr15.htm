  <strong>Description: </strong><br>
  On Saturday, April 15, 2006, Eggster will be holding its 12th annual Eggster 
  Hunt and Learning<br>
  Festival on the UC Berkeley campus from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The Eggster Hunt and 
  Learning Festival<br>
  is a completely student run, non-profit event, which seeks to unite children 
  and families in the<br>
  surrounding communities of the Bay Area for a fantastic day of educational experiences 
  and<br>
  cultural festivities through interactive learning booths, live performances, 
  and egg hunts. Last<br>
  year, we attracted over 3,000 children and families from the Bay Area. We are 
  hoping that your<br>
  group will be able to participate at some point during the day at the &quot;Eggster 
  Theater,&quot; which in<br>
  the past has included performances by Dance Junta, UC Martial Arts, and yourselves, 
  among others.<br>
  If you are interested in performing at this year's event, we ask that you confirm 
  your group by<br>
  emailing a response or by calling (see the number below) to reserve a 30 minute 
  time slot. If your<br>
  group is not interested or cannot make the date, please take a minute to email 
  me back with your<br>
  group name and a &quot;no&quot; in the subject line. If your group would like 
  to participate, please email<br>
  me back by January 15, 2006. I will be sending an email with more details once 
  I receive</font><br>
  <font size="2">confirmations. Thank you for your time.<br>

<p><font size="2">Hi everyone!</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Thank you so much for agreeing to perform at Eggster's Egghunt 
  and Learning Festival this year! Again, it will be held on the VLSB lawn on 
  Saturday, April 15th from 10 am-3 pm.<br>
  Please let us know if you will be available to perform at the times assigned 
  to your respective groups below:</font></p>
<p><font size="2">10:30-11 Satrang<br>
  11:30-12 Theatre Rice<br>
  12-12:30 Decadence<br>
  12:30-1 The Movement<br>
  1-1:30 Cal Jazz Choir<br>
  1:30-2 Cal Band</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Please arrive half an hour before your performance time to allow 
  sufficent time for your group to assemble and prepare before you perform at 
  our &quot;Eggster Theater&quot; (it's the area in front of the stairway on the 
  north side of VLSB, facing the lawn). You can also come by earlier to watch 
  other performances by other student groups or watch the kiddies and their families 
  visit our learning booths or watch the kids scramble for eggs in the egghunts. 
  Just be ready to go on stage before your scheduled time. If you have music you 
  will need for your performance, we'll have speakers and a cd player ready for 
  you.</font></p>
