  Hey Theatre Rice!<br>
  <br>
  This is O'Dao Lovanh. I am an intern for R.E.A.C.H !, an Asian/ Pacific Islander 
  Recruitment and Recruitment program at UC Berkeley. I am requesting to book 
  Theatre to perform for us on March 11th between 12pm and 2pm. <br>
  During this weekend, we will be hosting 55-60 high school students from Oakland, 
  Richmond, Sacramento, and Stockton for our bianual Shadow Night. They will arrive 
  on campus March 9th and will be leaving March 11th. We want them to leave with 
  a good impression of U.C Berkeley, a smile on their face, and laughter in their 
  soul, so we are hoping Theatre Rice will help us make that possible. We will 
  be providing the sound equipment and try to provide anything else that you guys 
  may need. I hope you guys are intersted, thanks. </font></p>
