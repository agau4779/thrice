  <strong>Description: </strong><br>
  January 2006</font></p>
<p><font size="2">To the Theater Rice,</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The ASUC is very excited to invite you to perform in the From 
  All Perspectives multi-cultural and performing arts showcase on Thursday, April 
  20th, 2006 in Zellerbach Hall at 7 pm. <br>
  <br>
  A collaborative effort between the ASUC and about fifteen to twenty student 
  performing arts groups, From All Perspectives brings together the many different 
  communities at Cal. It is a night to celebrate the cultural milieu unique to 
  the Berkeley campus and a time for the campus as a whole &#8211; regardless 
  of any affiliation &#8211; to come together and enjoy the diversity of our great 
  school. From All Perspectives seeks to unite all of Berkeley and not just specific 
  segments. Singing, dancing, theater and cultural groups from several different 
  backgrounds will perform in a two to three hour show tailored for the enjoyment 
  of all. From All Perspectives hopes to reach a wide audience by offering a variety 
  of performances on a world-class stage with affordable ticket prices ranging 
  from about $8-$10. Not only is From All Perspectives a chance to enjoy a show 
  in an at minimum $30 per seat venue, but also an opportunity for everyone in 
  the Berkeley community to experience a little bit of everything. <br>
  <br>
  We would be honored for Theater Rice to join us in this effort to promote the 
  diversity of Cal. Not only is this an opportunity for the campus to benefit, 
  but it is also a chance for your group to gain exposure amongst a wide audience 
  base. Zellerbach Hall seats about 2000 people and with the partnership of groups 
  that will be participating, Theater Rice will be able to reach a wider audience 
  for prospective shows. <br>
  <br>
  As a collaborative effort, we would like Theater Rice to take an active role 
  in the execution of this show. We are currently looking for a Stage Manager 
  and would love for him or her to come from the ranks of the participating student 
  groups. The ASUC cannot do this alone; it is the student groups who will ensure 
  the success of the From All Perspectives show. <br>
  <br>
  We are providing Zellerbach Hall, but we need your cooperation to help secure 
  the success of this collaboration. In order to be a part of this show, we need 
  the accountability of the Theater Rice. Besides performing on the day of the 
  show, Theater Rice would also need to go to the rehearsal on Wednesday, April 
  19th, 2006.We are also asking all participating groups to sell a very reasonable 
  number of tickets (at maximum five per performer) for the show. Each group will 
  be financially responsible for these tickets. <br>
  <br>
  We are currently working to procure outside funds in order to cover the costs 
  of Zellerbach Hall, publicity, etc. so that any profit can be given to the participating 
  groups. We want Theater Rice to be able to benefit from the show because From 
  All Perspectives is for you. For each extra ticket Theater Rice sells past its 
  required number, it will receive a share of the ticket profit. Presently, we 
  are considering several options for this arrangement. <br>
  <br>
  We would greatly appreciate any feedback and opinions. This show is for you 
  and it is nothing without you. <br>
  We will send a follow-up e-mail within the next week. Please consider this invitation. 
  We would love for Theater Rice to be a part of the 2006 From All Perspectives 
  show!<br>
  <br>
  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. We would love to 
  hear from you!</font></p>
