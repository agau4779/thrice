    2. Theatre Rice Budget Report<br>
  </strong>Each year we have to fill  out a Budget Report, Jonathan and I got together before Spring Break  and turned in our budgeting report for this year as well as requests  for next year. <br>
  <br>
  In order for everyone to get a better sense of the inner workings  of Theatre Rice (what Producer, Assistant Producer, and CFO's jobs are)  I've attached this budget report with this email. The excel spreadsheet  shows our expenses vs. revenues. We're projected to spend appx. $15,215  this year 2007-2008 and we're projected to have about $14,100 in  revenue. Some of you might be concerned that our expenditures are  higher than our revenues but we also get additional funding from the  ASUC about $2,600 per year. So we'll come out actually&nbsp; Also, we  currently have $12585.58 in our ASUC and misc accounts. So our  organization is quite financially sound. If you guys are interested  about the Budgeting process, feel free to ask me or Jonathan about this  process. I know some of you are interested.<br clear="all">
