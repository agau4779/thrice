<p>Howdy Ricers,</p>
<p>I just want to thank you guys for a terrific Open Rice Night. You guys displayed your wonderful talent to the Rice family and others in the audience. After watching Open Rice Night, I decided to flirt with the idea of having ANOTHER Open Rice Night. This still has to be worked out--but if time permits--there will be another Open Rice Night 2.0. Look out for that!<br>
    <br>
  This update will mainly give you guys a schedule of our External Performances that we've planned out. Externals are a great way for our troupes to get some extra performance time in as well as reaching out to our community and diversifying our audience. Part of the Assistant Producer's job is to facilitate and coordinate these external performances so as always, if you know someone who would like to have Theatre Rice in their performances, give them my email and let them contact me via this External Request Form (newly designed to help me document these externals and also help them figure out what they want).</p>
<p> <br>
  Here are the externals lined up for the next month. We've got 4 BIG events in the next 4 weeks. Theatre Rice will be well represented this semester! I've contacted some of you to help direct for this.<br>
