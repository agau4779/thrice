<div class="moz-text-html" lang="x-western">Hi
Ricers,<br>
<br>
A Foreword:<br>
<br>
Great
job on a productive and eventful weekend for our tech rehearsals. We
still have only three opportunities with tech to sharpen our pieces so
really try to focus and give it your all. Keep advertising the show
because we want the maximum turnout! One of the reasons we're letting
cast members sell tickets is to help with distribution and maximize our
ticket sales. So go market Theatre Rice and keep passing out our super
cool flier!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: Ticket Sales<br>
Our show starts at 7:30PM, the
Door opens at 7PM. There was a typo on the tickets so please do take
note. Tickets are $3. Go sell 'em! If you can't sell them, you will
return them to me before Friday of our show.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 2: VIP Guests<br>
EMAIL me your VIP Guest names
(FIRST NAME AND LAST NAME). You are limited to 8 guests total, but if
you really have a big big family or you're extra popular, send me an
email and I'll work something out. VIP Guest names are due Thursday
night at 11:59PM. Please confirm with your guests to make sure they're
coming. It would suck if we reserved a bunch of empty seats in the
front row where VIP guests usually sit. <br>

The Last Word:<br>
<br>
GO FIGHT WIN.<br>
