    <div>Howdy gang,</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>I want to thank real quick the people who will be involved this weekend in all our external events.</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>Firstly, thanks to Thomas (director), Joy, Dennis, Vanessa, Wafa,  Julius, Irene, Erika. We had a wonderful time hosting an improv  workshop at Pauley Ballroom for Reach Senior Weekend events. We had a  great time teaching and performing in front of about 50 high school  seniors. It's important for Theatre Rice to reach out to the community  and show off our stuff. </div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>Tomorrow (FRIDAY)&nbsp;we got two big events. </div>
    <div>From All Perspectives in Zellerbach, Show starts 6:30pm,  Chancellor will give a speech. We got Experimental troupe + Anthony and  Erika and then Monologue Troupe with Erika, Dennis, Julius, and myself.  Check us out if you can or at least tell your friends!</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>Senior Weekend Banquet. 7PM, we'll have "Olive Juice" performed by  Jonathan and Vanessa, you guys had a chance to watch it today, it  really helps them get their timing down when there's an audience so  thank you guys for staying! </div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>

    <div>We got an improv performance led by Thomas, please email Thomas if you like to perform! <a href="mailto:thomaserictan@gmail.com">thomaserictan@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;this is for bridges Senior Weekend</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>We also are performing at the I-House in their cultural show at  4PM. Monologue troupe will be there to perform. After the awesome  response I got today,&nbsp;I decided that it's fair to open it up to 1 or 2  more performers. If you guys would like to perform. Email me back.  Meanwhile think about a 2-3 minute monologue you like to give. You will  be performing alongside Erika, Dennis, Julius, and me!</div>
