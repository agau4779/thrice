<div lang="x-western">Hey gang, <br>
    <br>
  Great job  tonight. You guys really gave a solid performance in front of a  sold-out 155 Dwinelle. This is quite an accomplishment and I hope you  guys will use this momentum for tomorrow night's show!<br>
    <br>
  Tomorrow night we'll have some special audience members:<br>
  <br>
  1)  Of course like tonight, we'll have our awesome alums attending.  Saturday night we'll have approximately 30-40 alums attending the show. <br>
  2) ASUC organizers of the Annual From All Perspectives Show, we're  going to set up a gig with them for their Zellerbach event later this  semester. Look out!<br>
  3) Daily Cal staff writers. Everyone who reads the Daily Cal will know what we do!<br>
  <br>
  and...<br>
  <br>
  4) Representatives of the Asian American Theater  Company (the organization we decided to donate to for this Midsemester  Show) in the audience. They were founded in 1973 (talk about  pioneers)..Here's a blurb from their website <a href="http://www.asianamericantheater.org">http://www.asianamericantheater.org</a>: <br>
  <br>
  <em>"The Asian American Theater Company (AATC) was established in 1973 to  develop and present original works of theater about Americans of Asian  and Pacific Islander descent. More than three decades later, we are  still committed to producing groundbreaking, entertaining and  innovative art. We are not only a production company, but also a  workshop where Asian Pacific Islander writers, actors and directors can  explore ideas, understanding that we won't always know where those  ideas will lead. Whether these works end up in video, on film or on  stage, they carry with them the Asian American Theater's purpose: to  explore who we are as a people and a community, and in so doing, to  bring us closer together."</em><br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;  I've spoke to the Chair of the Board of Directors for AATC,  Darryl Chiang. He was the one who turned in the charity submission  form. He's coming to our show Saturday night with an  actress Pearl Wong. I did a quick search on Darryl... his resume is  quite impressive. Princeton '90 , Harvard Law '94, involved heavily in  non-profit organizations for Asian American art and performance and  also works as a corporate counsel (fancy name for a lawyer) for Google  and Hitachi. I'm really excited they could make it on such short notice  (I contacted them Friday morning)! He sounded extremely excited about  the opportunity to watch us (both on the phone and gchat, haha).<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;  What I find very cool about the organization is that although Theatre  Rice is certainly not as well-known as AATC, but they still take the  time and devotion to show support. The fact that the Chair is coming to  our show really says a lot about how important they believe our work  is. Also if you read in the charity submission form, AATC has worked on  projects with Duy Nguyen (one of the founders of TR) and Jimmy Tran in  the past. Really savor this opportunity and give everyone in our  audience a memorable experience!<br>
  <br>
  Rest easily everyone and thank you,<br clear="all">
