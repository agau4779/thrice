Mockshow</b><br style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif;">Meet
at 110 Wheeler this THURSDAY. The room's bigger so we can sit
comfortably while watching what each troupe has come up with. Be ready
to have your thinking helm ready though because your feedback is very
important. We ask for your honest opinion (it's anonymous) so we can
produce the best show on March 7th, 8th. See you at One-Ten Wheeler
Hall, Seven SHAWP.</span><br

<b>2. Midsemester Tech Week:<br>

it is again). Please mark your calendars <i>maintenant </i>(now)<i>.

shows really rely on great rehearsals during tech week. So please try
to plan ahead so that you can arrive promptly to each meeting. If there
is a conflict (like midterms or review sessions) you'll have to contact
both your directors and the stage/people manager(s) (this will be
determined later). Very important week, come on time, practice practice

</b>March
18th, We'll have our Open Rice Night where you guys can display your
talent to everyone. We've got Dwinelle 145 reserved. If you're
interested, contact me. We generally accept any form of staged
performance but also open to other ideas. Under 7 minutes is ideal but
we can talk about it if it's over. If you like to perform, start
practicin'! <i>Comprende </i>(understand)<i>?<br>

13th<br>
</b>Our second show
this semester is Theatre Rice Showcase May 2nd/3rd. It's also the show
where we accept material from outside-Rice. There's a Showcase
Submission process for everyone who's interested in directing or
submitting a piece to be performed in our Showcase. I also put the
Showcase Submission Form as an attachment to this email.<br>

</i><b>5. Theatre Rice Org Card Designs (New!)<br>
</b>We
like to have our official TR Organization Cards (like business cards
but we don't have a business). For now let's keep the dimensions same
as Show flier designs (</font>3.25" * 4.25" glossy <span
 class="nfakPe">fliers</span>) Stuff we'd like to have
on the card:<br>
<br>
Theatre Rice <br>
Modern Asian American Theater<br>
Founded in 1998<br>
UC Berkeley<br>
<a href="http://www.theatrerice.com/" target="_blank">www.theatrerice.com</a><br>
ASUC Sponsored<br>
% of proceeds go to charity (optional)<br>
Comedy - Improv - Drama - Film (optional) <br>
<br>
The
design can be open ended but one thing we envision is handing them out
to other people who like to find out more about our group including
other universities, campus groups, and our audiences. We also would
like the organization card to last at least a couple of years so we
don't have to design another one. So we want a clean look that gives a
sense of both professionalism and prominence. Please send your designs
to <a href="mailto:trexcomm@lists.berkeley.edu">trexcomm@lists.berkeley.edu</a>.
<b>Due Date is February 29th (Friday).</b><br>

<b>6. Theatre Rice Digital Camcorder (<i>Xin (</i>new<i>)</i>!)<br>
</b>We're
in the process of looking into investing a digital camcorder. We're
always open to suggestions, perhaps you've got experience in this
technology and/or a significant contributor to web consumer pages like
cnet. We're all ears. I'm personally a big fan of the Sony Handycam
HDR-SR 7 Digital with a 60 GB built-in hard drive, Zeiss lense, and 10X
optical zoom.<br>
<font size="2"><i><br>
</i><b>7. External Performances<br>
</b>Currently
we're in talks with many groups from many off campus organizations
including some with other universities. I'll announce them once they're
finalized so people can volunteer to perform at these fun events. Stay
tuned <i>eh </i>(okay)?<br>
