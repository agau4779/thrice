          o Tarp needed to protect against waterproofing
          o Anthony will procure it.

# Charity: AACI or AAAC

    * AAAC selected-matches mission statement more, more in-depth form, haven't donated to in the past
    * Email will be sent tonight, inviting them to the show, bring brochures if they want, etc.

# Publicity: Show publicity form for the two shows, add yelp review request, add option to give email address to get google survey about show content? Publicity feedback form AND content feedback

    * Paper survey: Advantages is that more variety of feedback as opposed to delay online. Incentive for surveys in terms of getting entered in raffles, discount off next show? More targeted questions. List a location where pencils or writing utensils are given

# Camcorder: Continued discussion

    * Historian in charge
    * Maintained purely for show/historian duties or for director check-out?
    * If available for director use, figure out a contract where historians would have guaranteed access. Form to guarantee financial liability.
    * Issues of release form clashing with ASUC property?
    * Start off the camera with the same policies as the projector? And consider opening it up later?
    * For archival, handheld is much more effective. Handhelds run 650? With warranty, case, tripod, 1000?

    * Should we have tech? Just run Q2Q.
    * One day as individual group practice?
    * Sound one day or lights the other?
